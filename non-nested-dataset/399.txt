I had the only vegetarian option I spotted on the menu, which was the <roasted <mushroom/> & <goat cheese sandwich/>.  Very good!  Great food and ready in a hurry.  I had a <salad/> that was drenched in too much dressing, so I couldn't finish it.  Not my favorite place ever, but if I'm in the Park again and am looking for food, I'll consider this a viable option.
