Came here with my girlfriends one Sunday afternoon. This place will take a long time to serve your food - as it took them almost an hour to give us our food. So make sure you give yourself lots of time! It is definitely a lazy brunch place!

Definitely recommend the <pancakes/>! Beware of the portion sizes - they are huge!
