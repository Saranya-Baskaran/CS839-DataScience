You like your <meat/> long, smoked, and spicy? They got that. 

Short and thick  with an au naturel casing? They got that too. 

Thin, floppy and tasting of <meatloaf/>? Hey, whatever gets your rocks off. 

The <sausages/> here are crazy amazing and they have just about any pork related product your little heart can dream up, ground to an appetizing taste and texture with just the right amount of spice. The prices are also more than fair compared to other meat markets around town.
