Very busy place here on a Friday night. Definitely has a queen street feel with the decor. 

Food is a little pricey but not bad. <Shrimp tempura/> appetizer is a good size for sharing. <Sweet potato wedges/> are well paired with the <wasabi mayo/>. 

Rolls are very good. They have a different <pink dragon roll/> that has <scallops/> on the top. <Green dragon rolls/> are definitely a must try. The <avocado/> is very thinly sliced sprinkled with something yummy on top.
