Went in on a whim and was not disappointed. I had the ODB and my husband had the <poutine/>. <Poutine/> was good...had pulled <chicken/> on it and was tasty, although not entirely unique tasting, but that's fine for this type of place. I had the ODB and it was AMAZE-BALLS! The <chicken/> was a huge portion, on a full <waffle/>. The <waffle/> was the perfect blend of sweetness, with just a bit of <syrup/> and the <chicken/> was crispy and great and so tender it just flaked apart. It had a great <sauce/> on top and the slight kick, blended with the sweetness of the <waffle/>, was a great mix. Portion size was good, food was delicious. Came with a little cup of <potato <salad/>...liked the <peas/>, nice touch and the <potato <salad/> was a refreshing touch for the whole dish. Still thinking about it hours later....thinking and thinking....*sigh*
