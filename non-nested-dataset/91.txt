We had Gaylord cater our wedding reception.  The staff was friendly and helpful, though they were especially good with setup and tear down.   The food was above average for a catering.  In particular their <stuffed Portobello Mushroom/> was quite nice. We also got some relatively healthy and tasty <potato and vegetable/> dishes.   They were also priced quite reasonably for what we got.

A good experience all around with no major negatives.  I would consider Gaylord for catering again.
