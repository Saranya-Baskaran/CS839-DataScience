Stopped here with a friend back in January.  The person who took our order was polite, and the sub I had (the only vegetarian one on the menu, I think) was pretty good.  The <smoothie/> I had, though, was more <ice cream/> and <sugar/> than <fruit/>, like it seemed to be advertised.  There's no table service here, which is perfectly normal for a <sub/> place, but I've had better <subs/> elsewhere, and way better <smoothies/> elsewhere, as well.  If I come back, I'll have the <sub/> and skip the <smoothie/>.
