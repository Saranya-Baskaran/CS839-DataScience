When I'm looking for a nice quiet drink in a clean bar this is always the place I choose. 

This is a place that I'd refer to as a bar for adults as opposed to those places where all those kids hang out.

Chances are you're not going to find a bunch of kids acting like they're having there first <beer/>. If someone decides to have a shot you wont have to listen to all there friends yelling "Shot, Shot, Shot, Shot"

Good food, clean, good service. A class place!
