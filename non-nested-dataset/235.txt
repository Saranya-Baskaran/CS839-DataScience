After a second trip here very little has changed about my review.  The food is good.  I ordered the <chorizo burger/>.  It was ok.  It could have used a lot more flavor.  The chorizo flavor was weak at best.  The <fries/> are good and you get a lot of them.

Two of the people in our group ordered the <hot <burger/> that they give you a warning about before they let you order it.  Avoid this <burger/>.  Not only is it blistering hot, it tastes horrible.  The <ghost chilis/> singe your taste buds and will ruin the rest of your meal.  I was expecting the heat, but i was not expecting the awful taste.
