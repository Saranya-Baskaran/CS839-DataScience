The service here was so terrible. We had to ask to get drinks, food, and water. The food itself was pretty good. We had the nachos for an appetizer, which was stacked about a foot high.

The golf is great and the view is fantastic.

Our main food did not arrive together, which was a little confusing. The <pizza/> arrived first, followed by <soup/> 5 mins later and <chips and salsa/> 10 mins after that. We canceled that.
