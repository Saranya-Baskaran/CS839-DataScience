I came here late night with a couple friends to have a <drink/>, eat, and hang out.  I love that they have the <black bean burger/> to substitute in for any of the <meat burgers/> on their menu!  The waitress\/bartender we had made me a delicious <cocktail/>, and was courteous throughout our stay.  The food was delicious, and the staff let us stay way after closing!  Thanks for helping to make my short Phoenix trip all the more pleasant!
