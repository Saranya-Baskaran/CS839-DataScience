This gem is tucked away in an alley at Green Valley's District area, but don't let that fool you - going here, you almost feel like you're no longer in Las Vegas, Nevada, but rather in a different part of the world.  It has a romantic, intimate feel.  The food is delicious, and the drinks are fantastic.  I came here yesterday to meet someone, and a friend of mine - Dominique - was bartending.  Others have commented on her ability to make incredible drinks, and I will add on to those positive comments!  Whether you ask for something on the menu, or something not on the menu, it will be one of the best drinks you get in all of Vegas.  I've lived here a little while, and I can testify with the <ice teas/>!  They are thinking of adding live music soon, out on the little patio out front; with the right artists, this can only add to the experience.  Definitely recommended!
