Decided to give this place a try based on the reviews. 

Service is really slow on a Thursday afternoon work day. It took almost 30 mins before we got our food. Definitely not the place to go during the work week.

Ordered a <pork bone soup/> which was just ok. Nothing special or memorable about it.

Not sure if I would come back again.
