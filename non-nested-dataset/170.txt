Okay, let me start by saying that YES I have had Montreal <bagels/> and NYC <bagels/> and they are of course, in a category all of their own. But let's focus on Toronto <bagels/>. 

Several months ago I had a hankering for <bagels/>. I decided to give What a <Bagel/> a try and was pleased with their prices and the taste. They were really, very good! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with a variety of flavours to choose from.
