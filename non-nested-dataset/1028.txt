Went to the restaurant here with a few of my gal pals for a later dinner, and really enjoyed the experience.  All of the servers and staff members I interacted with were very friendly and courteous.  I had the <tostada salad/>, and it was very yummy.  I wish there were more vegetarian options, but if I come back here I'll be happy to have that same <salad/> again or one of the other couple of meals.  Prices are great, too!
