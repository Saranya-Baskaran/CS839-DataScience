We got off to a questionable start as we were sat several minutes after our reservation time.  It was not a deal breaker, but it was annoying.  Our server was prompt and friendly.

The <bread/> is very good.  It is hard not to fill up on it before your meal comes.  We ordered a few <appetizers/> for the table.  I tried the <mozzarella marinara/>.  It was surprisingly good.  Most places you can tell the <mozzarella/> was pulled from the freezer right before it was fried.  The <mozzarella/> here had good flavor, and the portions are good sized.

To start off my meal I ordered the side portion of the <Maggiano's <Salad/>.  I always enjoy this <salad/>.  The house <dressing/> has good flavor.  The <blue <cheese/> and <bacon/> add great flavors too.  The portion is large.

For my main course I ordered the <veal Parmesan/>.  The portion is huge.  It comes with a side of <spaghetti/> as well.  The <veal/> is ok as far as flavor is concerned.  I have had better, but it was fine.
Not a bad airport. The concourses desperately need an overhaul.  The look and feel is dated.  The central terminal area is in better condition though.

The airport does have a good number of food options for a mid size airport.  That is a big deal.  We all want options.

The other issue is one that it is hard to hold against the airport, it is a US Airways hub.  I cannot not blame Charlotte for that.  You take what you can get, even if it is US Airways.
I had stayed at the Mandalay Bay in the past and was quite happy with those experiences. I found an amazing rate for The Hotel so i had to try it out. I really like the more secluded entrance. The check in process was quick and they make you feel important. 

The rooms are nice suites. Modern styling adorns the rooms. These are nice rooms. Not to the level of Wynn or Venetian, but only a few steps behind. My only complaint about the room is petty, but it was annoying. The clothes iron was tied to the ironing board. It made it difficult to iron my clothes. This is not a Motel Six, i should not have to fight a security cord on my iron. 

The Hotel area is a nice separation from the main portion of Mandalay Bay. The area has its own bar, store and amenities. It is nice to have the ability to step away from the mega casino feel for a few minutes.
This is a solid place for late night food.  It is not much to look at.  The service is questionable.  The food satisfies your late night Mexican cravings.  It is also cheap.

I ordered five <rolled <tacos/> with <sour <cream/> and <cheese/>.  <Rolled <tacos/> are <taquitos/> in my world.  You will need four or five <rolled <tacos/> to satisfy your hunger.  I think they come in five counts.  The taste is just OK.  A little <hot <sauce/> helps a lot.  You get a lot of <cheese/> and <sour <cream/>.

I tried a friend's <quesadilla/>.  It was packed full.  The taste was decent.  Another item where <hot <sauce/> goes a long ways.
The first issue is that there is only one entrance and exit.  That creates huge bottlenecks.  You are packed tight until you are back into the casino area.

The second issue is with the fact all of the concessions were cash only. There is no reason for this, inexcusable.  

Inside it is your standard small arena.  The size does mean you get good views from almost every seat.

The staff was a mixed bag.  Some were friendly and helpful, others were the opposite.
I was only in town for one night for work so there was no immediate need to stay on the main part of the strip. This casino is nearly to Stratosphere. That is ok if you do not intend to leave the casino much. They do have a stop on the monorail. That does help you get around, especially if you are attending an event at the convention center.

I got a great rate considering how many conventions were in town. Parking was relatively easy. They need to add signs in the parking garage that do a better job of pointing you to the casino entrance and check in. Check in was quick and painless. The front desk employee was friendly and helpful.

My room was small. The couch is at the foot of the bed, facing the bed and there is just enough room to walk around the bed on all four sides. The rooms is very modern. The bed and couch are made of plastic and are topped with cushions\/mattresses. You can turn on a light the lights the bed frame or couch frame from the inside. It is amusing for a few seconds. The bed was comfortable enough and it faces the window. The downside to facing the window is that the tv is mounted on a wall to the side of the bed so watching tv in bed is annoying.

The bathroom sink is in the bedroom area behind the headboard of the bed. The toilet is to one side of it with its own sliding door. The shower is on the other side with a similar sliding door. It is an odd set up, but not a deal breaker.

There are several very good dining options inside the casino. This is a definite plus. I did not get a chance to gamble on this trip, so I cannot speak to the casino floor activity. The casino is good sized and looked well put together.

Overall this is an ok option if you intend to stay here the entire trip or if you invest in a monorail pass. If the price is right give it a try.
After a second trip here very little has changed about my review.  The food is good.  I ordered the <chorizo <burger/>.  It was ok.  It could have used a lot more flavor.  The chorizo flavor was weak at best.  The <fries/> are good and you get a lot of them.

Two of the people in our group ordered the <hot <burger/> that they give you a warning about before they let you order it.  Avoid this <burger/>.  Not only is it blistering hot, it tastes horrible.  The <ghost <chilis/> singe your taste buds and will ruin the rest of your meal.  I was expecting the heat, but i was not expecting the awful taste.
I really wish Jimmy Johns would open some locations in Los Angeles.  It is a great lunch option.  The <sandwiches/> are flavorful and filling.  The <bread/> is quality and the toppings are fresh.  The staff at this location was friendly and quick.
We stopped in here for some <coffee/> to wake us up and warm us up. The line to order was short. That is where the good part ends. There were only 6-8 people in front of us on the other end waiting for drinks, so it seemed like it would not be too long of a wait. Oh was I wrong. The wait was far too lengthy and the staff did not seem eager to fix that. The manager casually strolled around clearly not noticing the back up. The two staff members making the drinks seemed to be enjoying themselves, but in no hurry to get the job done.

After finally receiving my <coffee/> I was then again disappointed. It tasted burnt and I could not detect any of the elaborate flavors in its description. Also please note that I waited that long for a <coffee/>, not a <latte/> or <cappuccino/>.

Had it been busier I would have understood, but the issue seemed to be the staffs ineffectiveness and disregard for getting work done.
Not a horrible place, but certainly not good.

I landed in one concourse of the A terminal and flew out of another within the same terminal.  I walked through the first and saw several food options which gave me hope for my options near my departure gate.  Unfortunately after my long walk to the other concourse I found there to be very limited options.  This I cannot understand.  Both concourses had a similar number of gates, yet one was loaded with options and the other completely lacked them.  Of course by the time i walked to my departure gate I did not have time to wander back to the other concourse, so I settled for a lesser option near my gate.

Just hope you do not have to change terminals or rent a car.  Either requires a bus trip.  That is a big pet peeve of mine.  At least you do not have to take a train like in Atlanta or Denver.

The last issue I will cover in this review is the fact that Southwest and US Airways hold most of the spots at this airport.  That is enough reason not to fly here.
This is a fairly good convention center. It is relatively new looking. It is located right in the middle of downtown near hotels and food options. The food court is large. That being said it is inconvenient if you are on the main floor two levels up. There are some decent options for quick food, but it would be nice if there were at least a couple options near the show floor area.

There were some food options inside the show area. These bring down the overall score. The line was tragically long and the options were severely limited. The long lines are likely a reflection of the food court being so far away.
There were two very large trade shows in town and it was the week leading up to the Super Bowl so finding a table was going to be tough.  Boa was able to sit us within 30 minutes.

We spent our 30 minutes in the bar\/lounge area.  It is a nice area, and they have a very good <wine/> and <liquor/> selection.

We were fortunate enough to get a seat by a window.  We were able to catch a glimpse of the strip and saw the fountain show at the Bellagio while we waited for our meal.

The food is very good.  I orderd the <filet mignon/> medium rare/> with a <blue <cheese/> crust/>.  It was prepared perfectly and tasted great.  The food is ala carte so we ordered the <onion brick/> and <truffle oil fries/> for the table.  The <onion brick/> was ok.  The <fries/> were great.  I love <fries/> prepared in <truffle oil/>.

The service we recieved was very good.  The environment is great.  It is worth the money for the occasional special meal.
We sat at the bar for a few minutes while we waited for our table.  They have an excellent selection of quality <licquors/>.  I was happy to see a good assortment of <whiskeys/>.

We started off the meal with the <Goat <Cheese Queso Fundido/>.  It was excellent.  By far the best <queso fundido/> I have had maybe ever.

They bring a good variety of <bread/> to the table.  I am partial to the <cornbread/>.  It has little pieces of <jalapeno/> baked in.

For my entree I chose the <Cascabel Chile Crusted <Rabbitt/>.  It was great.  It comes as a <tenderloin/> and a leg.  The <meat/> was tender, and the <sauce/> added great flavor.  Even the <toasted <cous cous/> was tasty.

This place is always busy.  Book your reservations several days in advance if you have a specific time in mind.
My stay started off very well. The front desk was very helpful. My room was not ready so she upgraded me to a much larger and nicer room. The problem is that the room probably is considered to be in another county. It was quite a walk. We went in Frank and Alberts for lunch. This was an odd experience. Four of us had meals with very small portions, and the other two meals were way too big of portions. The grilled cheese is an embarrassment to food, period. It is also a bit pricey for what you get. 

The room is nice but slightly dated. It had a 90's feel to it. This is OK in most hotels, but in a place like the Biltmore you can not let your rooms get that far behind. My room was huge. I had a full kitchen and living room area. 

There are several pools through out the property. The pool by my room was great because it was in a low traffic area. I was able to swim in peace any time of day. 

Parking can be a pain. I would recommend using the valet, but if your room is where mine was you have to walk over a 1\/4 mile to get to the valet. 

There were some renovation taking place, so hopefully that will update the overall look of the rooms. The area as a whole is nice. There are some very good views.
This review is for the casino only.

I am not a big time gambler.   I love to play, but I only play $5 or $10 tables as I hate losing money.   I can play for a long time even if I am losing and not go broke.   That is why I was excited to hear NY NY was adding $5 tables blackjack.  It worked, it got me to gamble there for the first time.

You usually have to wait for a seat to open up, but it usually only takes a few minutes.  No issues with that.

I have only one issue.   It is the dealers.  They completely lack personality.  I have tried on multiple occasions and it does not matter who you get.   They rarely speak at all.  They just deal like robots.

I have given up trying.  I will be going elsewhere for my gaming needs.
This is an ok optional for a casual lunch. The service was ok as was the food. The place is deep and narrow with a long bar on one side. The decor is ok.

The <chips/> and <salsa/> they bring out is ok. The <chips/> were crispy and the <salsa/> had ok flavor. For my meal I ordered the <steak/> stacked <quesadilla/>. You get a good sized portion. It should fill up most people, especially after snacking on <chips/> and <salsa/>. I would have liked the <steak/> to have better flavor. It certainly could have benefitted from some <seasoning/>. The <chipotle aioli/> inside does make up for the bland flavor of the <meat/>. None the less, the <meat/> should stand on its own if needed.

Our server was ok. She came around with good frequency but made a few small mistakes with the orders. Overall it was an ok experience.
This is a good place to stop and relax for a minute to do some people watching.  They have a good drink menu with solid <scotch/> choices.

They also have cigars.  It is a small selection, but there are good options.  They kindly provide a cutter and a proper cigar ashtray. 

They also bring out small snack bowls which is nice.  The <chips/> were very good. I was quite surprised. 

Our server was nice and helpful, but service was a bit slow.  Everything is on the upper end of the price scale.
The food is good for the most part.  It falls short in speed and value.  The to-go option is convenient but takes way too long.  They offer good portions and solid food, but it is priced like it is a higher level locations.

The <chili cheese fries/> were quite tasty.  The <chili/> and the <fries/> both had good flavor.

The <queso <cheese/> dip/> is ok.  The flavor is ok, but I expected more bold flavor from the <Chorizo/>.

It is not a bad option, but you will have to be patient and be willing to pay a little more than it is worth.
The experience started out great.  I saw they had <philly cheesesteak nachos/> and I had to try them.  Order the large portion if you have more than two people.  There was plenty of <cheese/>.  They even used <Cheese Whiz/> like a true <Philly sandwhich/>.  There was plenty of <cheese/>, but very little <meat/>.  After eating off the top few <chips/> the <meat/> was gone.  They really need to double the <meat/>.

For dinner I attempted to order the <BLT/>, but they were out of <bacon/>.  I settled for the <chicken strips/>.  It was your standard issue <chicken strip/> meal.  Not bad, but I could do the same on my own from the <frozen food/> section at any grocery store.

Our server was nice, and attentive.  That was easy though because the place was nearly empty.
This is a decent very casual lunch spot.  The chips and salsa are solid.  We opted to add queso for more flavor.  The queso has good flavor.

We split an order of steak nachos.  They are prepared differently than most nachos.  There are four large chips with toppings stacked high on them.  The chips have quite a bit of steak on them.  They have ok flavor.  Not bad, but not a lot either.

They have an assortment of your standard drinks found at most Mexican joints.  The prices are inline with other casual casino options.
As a few others that have reviewed this place have said, they do have pretty ladies working.  Unfortunately the food is not as good.  Most of us ordered burgers.  That seemed like a great idea since they had so many options.  Unfortunately the burgers are not good.  Thankfully I ordered the whole wheat bun.  It was just fine.  Everyone else went with the standard bun which was hard as a rock.

The toppings were great but the burger its self was bland and simple.

There are a lot of televisions. so it is probably a good place to catch the game with friends.  I would just eat before you get there.
The Luxor is just one small step above Excalibur.  That is not a compliment for anyone who does not know the area.  On the surface it is not that bad, but then you start seeing things.  Maintenance is clearly not a priority.  Also the elevators are horrible.  They shimmy and shake all the time.

The rooms are kind of OK.  I did have an issue getting a consistent temperature in the shower.  The rooms, hallways and elevators are in need of some updating.

If you are on a tight budget this will do in a pinch.  It is not for me, but it has its place.
This is an ok place. I do not share everyone else's enthusiasm for it, but it is perfectly acceptable for a casual meal. The layout is odd. There are many odd sized rooms. In the evening they do have live music often.

The food is ok. I ordered the Irish Nachos. They consist of fried potato slices topped with beer cheese sauce, chives, aioli and green onions. I chose to add steak. You get a good amount of food. It is more than enough for a meal for one. Several people could also spit it as an appetizer. The chips had solid flavor and were crisp enough. The toppings were all ok.

The service was ok. Our server was not rude, but also not overtly nice. It also would have been nice for her to come by a little more frequently.
The Hard Rock is a very good off-strip casino.  The off-strip part is also its greatest negative.  If you do not plan to leave the casino much than this is a good choice.  The Rio and The Palms are also very good off-strip choices.

Pay attention to which tower you book.  That way you know which parking garage to use.  Otherwise you could have a mile long walk to your room at check-in.

We stayed in the Paradise Tower.  The rooms are average in size.  The decorations are modern with the obviuos rock style.  The beds are comfortable.

The casino floor is not that large, but there are some $5 tables for those on a budget.  There is a convenience store and a Starbucks inside.  There are a few decent places to dine.

The pool area is good.  There is even a small sandy beach area by the pool.  It would be nice if it was a bigger area, but it is fun none the less.  The pool area generally has a party atmosphere, especially on weekends.

As I said, if your goal is to spend any amount of time on the strip stay on the strip.  If you want to just hang out in the one place and party, then Hard Rock is for you.
This place has a ton of potential, but it is not anywhere close to that level yet. It is in a prime location. The bar is large with a few different seating options. There are a few high minimum black jack tables inside. The decor and set up is cool. There are plenty of televisions to catch the game on.

They have a great selection of <whiskey/> and <scotch/>. There are several uncommon options of both, including several high end choices. The problem is the drinks are priced like a high end establishment, but the staff and clientele are not at that level. I get that it is impossible to control in a casino, but if I am going to pay for top shelf booze, I expect at least a minimum level of civility. I guess I am just getting old and grumpy.

The staff was nice, but not well versed in the fine selection they had available to them. I also overheard one of them telling a customer next to me he was not that good at mixing drinks. I guess at least he is at a <whiskey/> bar so many of the drinks will be neat or on the rocks.

Later in the evening a DJ came in. She played a good selection of music, but clearly was playing a preset set list and was not mixing the songs at all. Not a horrible thing, but if that is all your are going to get save the money and let Pandora handle the music.
This place seems to take a beating in the ratings and I am not completely sure of why. It is an ok quick, casual place to grab some food. The service was quick and the person who took our order was very friendly. You order at the counter and then pickup a little further down.

I ordered an <Italian <Sausage/> and Poutine/>. The sausage and roll it came on were both solid. With a little <mustard/>, I was happy with them. The <poutine/> was fairly good. The fries comes topped with <cheese/> curds/>, <bacon/> and <gravy/>. It is a good sized portion.

If you are looking for a casual place to get a quick, cheap meal this is an option.
You are not going to find much better views of the Las Vegas strip.  We sat at a table on the bar side of Mix.  That is where the best views are.

The bar has a few great <appetizer/> options.  It helped tide us over until our dinner much later that night.  The <mac and cheese/> was tasty, as were the <potatoes/>.

They also have a nice drink menu.
Just by having <queso fundido/> with <chorizo/> on the menu T&T was off to a great start. It was pretty solid <queso/> too.

Then to my surprise I found another of my Mexican favorites, <street corn/>.  It was great.  It had a lot of flavor.

This is a good place to get some decent Mexican in Las Vegas.
This is a good option downtown especially if you have an event at the convention center. You can walk to everything from here. Overall this is a good choice for the area. 

The decor is nice, but could use some updating. The staff is friendly. The rooms are inline with expectations. I do not like having to pay for internet, especially daily, so that was a mild inconvenience. There are two bar options in the hotel. There is also a cafe that serves Starbucks and some breakfast pastries. There is a restaurant on site as well. I only tried it for breakfast. That was very disappointing but i will save that for my review of it.
It was a busy night, so they told us about a 30 minute wait. Ok, no problem, we just went over to the bar for some drinks to burn some time. The problem though was the fact that we walked by several open tables that suited our group size. We just wrote it off to maybe being down a server. That was until they sat us forty minutes later at one of those very tables that was open when we walked in.

The bartender was good. He moved quickly and was on top of things. He also worked with our server to transfer our tab to our table. A simple thing that many places will not do so it was appreciated.

Our server at the table was also good. He came by often and was friendly. His visits got a little too space out toward the end, but overall it was good.

There are plenty of televisions to catch the game, or many games for that matter. There is a large bar area and a lot of regular seating as well. They had a live band in later in the evening. I am normally ok with this at a bar, but it confuses me at a sports bar. Especially with so many great 8pm games on. Also for whatever reason it was very warm inside. It was slightly crowded at times, but not enough to justify the excessive heat.

The food was ok. I ordered 8 <boneless <wings/> in the <flaming <Parmesan sauce/>. The <sauce/> had decent flavor, but was certainly not flaming. The <wings/> were large, but slightly over cooked. Not burnt, but overly crisp.

I also ordered the <Steel Town Spuds/> with <tater tots/>. You get a good sized portion. The <tots/> come topped with <ranch dressing/>, <bacon/>, <scallions/> and <melted <cheese/>. The flavor was ok. They brought out some <buffalo <sauce/> to dip it in and that made it much better.
This is an ok dinner option at The Palms. The decor inside is cool. The service is ok. The food is solid. The prices seem ok. It adds up in a hurry though, especially if you add appetizers or sides.

We ordered several options for our table so we could try more things. I tried a little bit of the following; <General Tao's Chicken/>, <Boiled Beef Tenderloin/> in <Szechuan Sauce/>, <Kung Pao <Beef Tenderloin/> American Style/> and the <white rice/>. Each was ok. None of them stood out as being exceptional or bad.

The time we were there it was not busy so reservations were not needed. During weekends or peak times you will want to make reservations though.
If you self park MGM gets off to a bad start.  The entrance from the parking garage is pathetic.  Once you get into the actual building you wander through a hallway of shops that reminds you of a bad mall that is about to close for good.  First impressions mean a lot.  Clearly not a lot of thought was put into this.

Once you are off the escalator and into the lobby it gets much better.  The lobby area is huge and it looks good.  The elevators to the guest rooms are actually close to the lobby.  More casinos should be set up that way.

The rooms look nice.  They are good sized.  The bed is very comfotable.  The bathroom is quite nice.

My issue with the rooms is the television.  You can be operating a serious hotel of any kind with 27" tube televisions.  This needs to be fixed.  Even the Tropicana now has 42" hi def flat screens in most rooms if not all rooms.

I liked that there was a 24 hour shop right by the elevators.  It made it easy to get a cola or a snack any time of day since there was not a minibar in the room.

There are a lot of options for food.  From fast food to the only five star place for hundreds of miles.  It is a great idea to have multiple Starbucks.

The pool are is quite a walk from the hotel rooms.  It is a very nice complex.  It was nice to have at least one pool off to the side for adults only.  The service at the pool was good and there are a lot of lounge chairs.

The gaming area is nice and quite large.  There is a nice spread of minimums to fit most budgets.  Most of the dealers are friendly and helpful.

The MGM Grand will now be an option for me when I visit Las Vegas.  The rates are competitive with casinos that offer far less.
I would recommend reservations, especially during peak hours on weekends. The line system they have for walk ups is a little inefficient. That being said this is a good casual option.

The decor is cool, and well appointed. Once we were sat the experience was very good. Our server was attentive and friendly. Our seat was conveniently on the outer edge so we got to do some quality people watching.

For my meal I ordered the <Huevos Rancheros/> with no <black <beans/>. It consisted of a crisp <tortilla/> topped with <chorizo/>, <cheddar cheese/> and <Hickman's Farms <eggs/>. It was a good brunch sized portion. The flavors combined together nicely. I am a little biased though as I do love <chorizo/>.
Went last night for V-Day and it was fantastic despite a very busy evening.  Inside, really not much different than the Atria's it replaced... except for the pics of Big Mike.  Had a couple of drinks at the bar and the bartender was quick, witty, and engaging although very busy.  Nice job!  We didn't get the V-Day special (2 meals for $100), but went for the separate meals.  Quick service, drinks were promptly brought to the table, as well as a bread basket which they even replaced for our take-home!  

Our server, Peggy, was prompt and on top of her game.  I started with a Caesar Salad which was really enough for 2 and was excellent.  Fresh and not too much dressing as they sometimes get. Timing was perfect between courses and the meals were very well done.  She got the twin <lobster/> tails/> with <asparagus/> and <rice/> pilaf/> and I got the <prime rib/> with a <baked <potato/>.  The tails were perfect and the <rice/> pilaf/> was a bit different, but very fresh and not overly salty.  My <prime rib/> was a bit on the rare side, which I usually order medium rare, and a bit unevenly cooked.  But the flavor and crust were phenomenal so that evened out to me.  Every bite melted in your mouth.  Never even used the <au jus/> or <horseradish <sauce/> (which was a bit too bland for me, then again I used to grow my own!).  

We don't do <dessert/>, but by the looks, and empty plates from those around us, they were excellent.  Chef came out to check on our table which is always nice and management staff was active and busy.... even helping to clear tables with smiles on their faces.  Not sure where the negative comments come from, but I've eaten in many fancier places and this stood right up to most of them.  

Maybe they've upped their game and cleaned up the kinks.  I'll definitely be back especially since it's right down the street!!
Bad customer service, horrible for a 4 diamond hotel. Underneath the trained smiles to pacify you they don't do much to fix anything. Spent A lot of money on a Penthouse loft and the room was horrible, wall paper were peeling off in the bathroom and the carpet was wet. They say someone overflowed the bathtub and flooded the place. At least fix the problem before the next guess. So the apologized and invited me back this year to make up for the problem, great right that is a good move until they check me into an suite that had dog urine on the carpet, and they moved me to a lower floor but took them over a day to move me and did not tell me how long it would take we will call you when its ready, 5 calls and 3 visits to the front desk the room was ready at 3 pm the next day waisted the whole day for these people. Too many incidents to be a 4 Diamonds.... I don't think so
Solid <beers/> -- <Christmas <Ale/> defines my holiday season.  I moved away a long time ago, but whenever I am home, I try to make a stop at Great Lakes.  Great vibe, super chill, stellar food and beer.
Dear Macayo's, 

I would like to thank you for renewing my hatred for your bland, artery busting Meximerican food. I hadn't experienced your brand of deep fried crap since I came of majority and stopped dined out with the family at restaurants that specialized in satisfying even the blandest of palettes. I must say, you continue to exceed my wildest expectations in that respect! I had to continue looking down at my plate just to make sure the 3,000+ calories I was consuming were more than just a mirage of Mexican food.

I will admit that I have a long standing, simmering hatred for you, Macayo's. So maybe this biases my opinion a bit. I can't in my right mind fathom why I thought you deserved a second chance last night. I think it's testament to the fact that sometimes I make super stupid decisions on an empty stomach, especially when I'm hungry enough to eat the ass end out of week dead burro. I suppose I was expecting something a bit more appetizing than that stretch of hyperbole. How wrong I was.

Your patio was the highlight of the evening. It's backed up against a lake and there was a duck that watched me eat. He had a shiny green head. It was nice. I made him my zen when all I wanted to do was lash out in frustration over the meal. If I could offer a suggestion to benefit both the <duck/> and myself, perhaps you could pipe some music out onto the patio, because listening to Suzie and Sally Suburb bitch about their waistlines while committing refried sin was pretty grating.

The food however, far outshone those cackling soccer moms in terms of annoyance. I don't know who you think you are, Macayo's, but charging 10-15 bucks an entree at your establishment just about gave me a heart attack long before the lard had a chance to bully up on my arteries. Maybe it's because I think you have the street value of a gum job from a run down whore, but I have to say that those prices were shocking. I could travel the valley over and find better Mexican food for much cheaper. For that price, I expect outstanding quality and taste, or at least a hip see and be seen environment. All you have is a <duck/> working in your favor. 

I do have a serious question for you though, what's with smothering your entrees in cream cheese and trying to pass it off as <Baja <sauce/>? It was the same jalapeno spread I get on my <bagel/> in the morning, but with even less heat and flavor. I suggest renaming it <Manhattan <sauce/> in honor of the <bagel/> and <schmear/> capital of the nation, and I think it would be a touching homage to the Pace Picante "New York City?!" commercials. 

I also can't understand why the majority of your entrees offer either rice or beans, but few have these in conjunction. Those are universal standards at a Mexican food joint, and the ultimate test of quality since they're comparable the valley over. Do they bring you shame? Is that why you don't want to offer them both? Or are you just a cheap nickel and diming motherfucker, Macayo's? 

I'm more apt to believe the latter, because you charged me two bucks for guacamole without informing me that it cost extra. Then you delivered a pile of gelatinous green goop of questionable origin that had absolutely zero flavor. By this point in the meal I really shouldn't have been surprised at how bland everything was, because I was on to your ploy of substituting flavor for gobs of <cream cheese/> and a heavy hand with the <salt/> shaker. But despite stiff competition from the bland pico de gallo and the puzzling "<Baja <sauce/>", it was the shitamole took the grad prize of suckdom for the evening. I have never tasted weaker <guac/>. You must have used some terrible <avocados/> and whipped them with <corn syrup/> or some other food-like filler. There wasn't a zing of <cilantro/> or <lemon/> juice/>, no hint of <Serrano/> spiciness, not even the tang of some <onion/>, although I did see a couple soggy <tomatoes/> bits added for color. 

I don't think I will ever be coming back, Macayo's. It's not you, it's... I can't lie; even to spare your feelings. It's you. It's all you. I'm breaking up in a public setting because I'm scared that you'll key my car while by back is turned, or at the least smother it in <cream cheese/>. I know you're into that freaky shit.

Wishing you deep fried broken dreams,
Erica
I really dig a good ole Mom and Pop greasy spoon diner.

Unfortunately, with the corporate skullduggery muscling out the competition and brainwashing America to embrace the familiar mediocrity of preformed, seasoned sawdust, they're few and far between. I mean, if I want a microwaved meal the same 50 states over, I'd go to Applechilidennybee's. If I want some down home, from scratch, mama couldn't have made it better cookin', I'll go to Cindy's. 

Being a small business, the decor is a little hokey. They're not spending money on some razzledazzle, flash and awe marketing flare. (They have ads embedded into the varnish of their table tops, people! They're selling dining space for revenue! Just so they can keep their entrees cheap as sin!) We sat in a room that was a shrine to John Wayne, big enough to accomodate our 8 person group. There were no less than ten pictures of The Duke. (That includes four duplicates of that wacky picture where the scale of his hat is off and it cuts into his head about an inch.) And to top it all off, there was a mirror running the length of the other side of the room, ensuring that double The Duke stared down at us as we ate. Weird.

But what this little place lacks in ambiance, it makes up for in food. I had a tuna melt on rye that was to die for. Anyone who knows me can vouch for the fact that I believe the <tuna/> melt/> to be a <sandwich/> of the gods. Fuck ambrosia. They were eating warm albacore over buttery, crisp <bread/>, smothered in <cheddar <cheese/> and pan fried to perfection. And the fries were sprinkled with some kind of magic pixie dust that endowed them with the ability to make me profusely salivate.

Everyone at the table ordered something different (from the <hot roast <beef/> dinner to the <fried <fish/>, <Caesar <salad/> to the <pork/> fritter sandwich/>) and it was agreed that all entrees were wicked, fricken good. And breakfast is served all day long. Super score!

So go, pay homage to John Wayne, and he shall reward you with some good eats!
I suppose I should write a review here since my little Noodle-oo is currently serving as their spokes dog in the photos. 

We both love Scooby Do's. They treat my little butt-faced dog like a prince and are receptive to correcting anything about the cut that I perceive as being weird. Like that funny poofy pompadour. Mohawk it out, yo. Done. In like five seconds my little man was looking fabulous and bad ass. Not something easily accomplished with a prancing pup that literally chases butterflies through tall grasses. (He ended up looking like a little lamb as the cut grew out too. So adorable.)

The shampoo they use here is also amazing. Noodles usually smells like tacos (a combination of beef stank and corn chips) but after getting back from the Do's, he smelled like Christmas morning! Sugar and spice and everything nice instead of frogs and snails and puppy dog tails. He's got some gender identity issues to deal with. 

The pricing is also cheaper than some of the big name conglomerates out there. I'm talking to you Petsmart! I've taken my other pup to Smelly Dog before, but unless I need dog sitting play time after the cut, I'll go with Scooby's. They genuinely seem to like my little Noodle monster.
Love, love, love A Taste of the Caribbean! The braised oxtails are heavenly, succulent and fall off the bone tender. They had me audibly moaning with delight the entire meal. The plantains and braised cabbage on the side were perfect sides, and the rice with pigeon peas was perfect for sopping up all that oxtail sauce. 

The jerk chicken was also fantastic, but since I was so busy hoarding my oxtails I didn't get to try much of it. The jerk was smoky, spicy, and highlighted the chicken instead of overpowering it. Same sides, so at least we didn't have to fight over those. 

Make sure to try the hibiscus flower drink (sorrel) with cloves floating in it. It accompanies the earthy, spicy flavor palate of the meat well and is very similar to the jicama offered up at Mexican joints.

The atmosphere of this place is wonderfully warm and inviting. The eclectic and bold paint decorating the walls is very reminiscent of the Caribbean, and the faux-rattan chairs help with the vibe too. There's also a couch against one side of the restaurant that is kind of out of place, but who am I to judge decor? Nothing in my house matches. 

In that respect it's kind of like being invited over to a friend's house for dinner and having her mom whoop up some of the most amazing ethnic food you never get at your Kraft mac n cheese house. It's clearly a family owned joint with all ages bumming around the kitchen. Kiddos bring out water, adolescents with hip hop ring tones take your order, and the matriarchs keep them all in line. It's energetic and engaging and utterly delicious. 

Next time I need leave room for the cassava or coconut cake! (Much harder to do than you may think. Trust me.)

Oh, they also have some interesting breakfast options like smoked fish and such. Don't worry, they also have regular old eggs on the menu. Check it out one morning for something outside of the norm!
I stumbled upon this little shoppe (I feel compelled to put the Old English spin on it since it's such a cutesy little store) when I was at my wits end. It was my father's birthday and I couldn't think of a thing to get the most unhelpful man ever. "Whatta you want? Whatever. Like what? You don't have to get me anything." Oh, but I do.

My beacon of hope was tucked away in a tiny little strip mall, sandwiched by a Dunkin' Donuts, a Japanese food mart and a liquor store, with a simple sign advertising, "Irish Gifts." Salvation! He's all about heraldry and Irish pride, but would the offerings be too chotchke to actually give anyone? Like leprechaun print boxers and Kiss Me I'm Irish ties he'd only wear one day during the year? 

Nope. This place is a class act. 

When I first entered the store I was shocked at how much stuff they had crammed onto the floor space. It would have been claustrophobic had they not utilized barriers (also decorated with stuff) that lead you into different areas of the store. The owners also run the place and immediately greeted me. 

I was pleasantly surprised at the wide variety of Irish themed offerings. They had everything from the goofy offerings I had imagined to beautiful jewelry, china and crystal ware. They even had a whole section of imported Irish food, including tea, sweets and refrigerated stuff like sausages. He ended up with some glassware with decorative pewter insignias ranging from Celtic knots to Claddagh rings. 

The people who own it are friendly and immediately helpful in finding anything you need, ordering what they don't have or calling the competition to see if they can secure that special something, something I appreciate. I've been frequenting the place since, snatching up Guinness themed merchandise for friends and fun Irish gifts for other members of my family. My dad even purchased his wedding rings from the place and a lovely Celtic cake topper of a man and woman with knot work circling it.

The prices are a wee bit steep, but they won't have your wallet crying out in protest. And for imported goods at a specialty shop, it's completely understandable. 

Don't forget to sign up for the Shamacus (shamrock-cactus! nyuk, nyuk!), a newsletter that arrives quarterly or so with all sorts of recipies, stories, and specials on their merchandise. You'll want to keep in the know about the Highland games and how to make some wicked shepard's pie.
Pizza is mega rad. I'm a sucker for chewy, bubbly crust like theirs. And you can't beat the lunch specials at less than five bucks for pizza and a drink! Salad bar is a little sketch sometimes at this location. I've seen too many young ones duck the sneeze guard and get crazy with the toppings.
I just don't think I'm much of a brewery gal. Granted, the beer here blows Four Peaks out of the water, but I'd much rather have a nice cocktail than chew though a specialty brew. But if beer is your poison of choice, they've got just about everything. The happy hour is kind of weak here though, with like a buck off all drafts. Thoroughly meh.

You can peruse the coolers and grab a cold one or choose from 20+ drafts they have on the menu. No Bud Light here though. Sorry frat chumps. They used to have a ton of wine here as well (like, ages ago) but it has since been narrowed down to just four choices, none of which were calling my name this last go round. Their Orange Blossom wheat beer was a bit like drinking an orange creamsicle in beer form. Almost like a cider with floral notes, a light finish and a super creamy mouthfeel. (Oh yeah, bitches. I just went there.) The perfect beer for the novice drinker to enjoy. Their IPA was also pretty decent, but was more bitter than I care for, although it stayed far away from feeling like I was drinking a bottle of grassy perfume. Solid.

I thought they had deals on happy hour food (again, like a buck off) but last time I went it was no dice. At least the food's reasonably priced. Tasty rueben, craptastic hummus, crispy quesadilla. 

The acoustics in this place are kind of shitty, so go on an off time when it won't be packed, or run the risk of smiling and nodding amicably while hearing every other snippet of convo. The high top tables are also really uncomfortable for shorties like me to sit at, but c'est la vie. My biggest peeve about this place is the gigando assy television against the wall. For a place this small, a big ass mofo tv is just  not the way to go.
I am a geek. I don't know why, but I really like establishments with the word monkey in the name. Tickles me pink at an adolescent level, like nut shots and fireworks. So Uncle Monkey's Bar started off at an advantage. 

It's definitely a dive bar, so don't go in there expecting something fancy schmansy. It's got monkey in the bar name, people. That should pretty much tell you everything you need to know about what awaits you inside.

Cash only, cheap alcohol (11 bucks for three shots of Jameson, and one fifty well!), stiff drinks, pool tables, and a decent jukebox. Pretty much all you need to satisfy this little barfly. Admittedly, I was a little drunk on crappy bowling beer by the time we got here, but I had an absolute blast. There might also have been darts, but when I'm seeing double bull's-eyes it's unlikely I'm going to be getting many double bull's-eyes, so the option entered and left my brain pretty quick.

The stand out decorations were a painting of a tarted up cartooney monkey in the women's bathroom and two creepy mannequins, a flannel clad lumberjack and a tomahawk carrying "chief." Granted, it's probably not politically correct, but it's definitely perplexing and helps drive home the fact that Uncle Monkey's doesn't give a flying fuck about catering to anyone that doesn't fit the dive bar mold. It's dark, weathered, kinda dingy and it exists for the express purpose of getting' you loaded, and the patrons reflect this fact by looking a little frayed around the edges as well.

The one issue I had with the place is the fact that it's hidden away in the corner of a non-descript strip mall with no sign on the front, so if you don't know about this place, you're unlikely to be finding yourself sharing a drink with the yokels.
Caffe Boa is a hidden gem on Mill Avenue, for both eating, drinking and relaxing with friends. It's a little bit on the pricey side though, so take advantage of the happy hour and half-priced sangria Sundays.

It used to be a tiny, homey little cafe next to Long Wong's at 7th Street and Mill and has since been converted into a spacious, classy winery and Italian bistro at 4th Street and Mill.

Happy hour specials are only extended to the bar area, which is tiny in comparison to the rest of the area. There's the traditional happy hour from 5 to 7, and a reverse happy hour that begins after 10 pm. (Check which days this is available though, because I'm not sure it's daily.) Draft beers like Guiness and Harp are two bucks, wine by the glass is half off (3 to 6 bucks after the discount), as are their fancy pants cocktails (generally 5 bucks)--the espresso martini is decadent--and all appetizers aside from the huge cheese plate are half priced. One wonky thing about the tab for happy hour is that they take the discount off at the end, so just keep a running tab in your head of how much you owe if you're with a group to make things go a little smoother.

I'm in lust with the Shrimp Adriatico, which is an appetizer that has five big tiger shrimp swimming in garlic tomato sauce that's served with a loaf of bread for dipping. It's filling enough to serve as an entire meal, or to share among friends.

On Sundays, pitchers of sangria are half priced ($15 instead of $30) and are a refreshing way to relax with a group of friends in the afternoon. I prefer the white wine over the red because it compliments the freshly sliced apples and muddled citrus. Make sure to ask them to go easy on the cinnamon though, or you may end up with an overpowering flavor and chalky texture.

Dinner is always divine as well, but a little bit on the pricey side. The meals are huge though, so you're pretty much guaranteed leftovers or you can split an entre with another person for an extra 3 buck charge. The Voodoo Penne is a delicious Cajun flavored dish, Lucas' Meatballs are savory and filling, and the Pola Pola is some awesome artichoke ravioli. Everything is done well and I rarely encounter problems with the servers or bartenders.

It's a nice, mellow break from the hubbub of Mill Avenue.

***UPDATE***
I've been a little peeved lately at the happy hour, since it's only extended to the bar and the bar is so damn tiny. Now I understand that if I don't get there around 5 I have no chance of getting a seat. That's fine. But the damn Chase employees get there around 4:30 (before Happy Hour even starts, where's the logic in that?) and hog all the damn seats, leaving me with nothing but shattered hope and an empty glass. You better shape up, Caffe Boa, or I'm docking a star!
***UPDATE***
You've been docked a star Boa. You went and increased the prices of your entrees by three bucks at the very least. Fuck you and your scrumtious, mouth watering 19 dollar spaghetti and meatballs. They're fucking meatballs, Boa! Plus your half price on glasses of wine less than 10 bucks is a pretty useless deal now. Jeezy creezy.

This isn't goodbye though. I'll still chill with you on Sundays for the sangria, but I shall never indulge in the pola pola, voodoo penne or your shitty Willow Bakery bread again. Bastards.
I live a stone's throw from this Safeway and never end up here for groceries. Based on experience, if I cart my lazy ass down to the Fry's at Thomas and 44th, I end up spending about 1\/4 less on my shopping trip than I do at this Safeway. Everything is ridiculously expensive, even after the "club card" savings. 

I have no idea why. Is it because it's in Arcadia? Is it the added expense of upkeep involved in over-stocking the wine section, or the fancy olive bar, or the gourmand cheese selection? Or maybe it's the added cost of employing cashiers by not installing self-check out lanes. Do I really have to stand in line for ten minutes behind a suburbanite with 2.5 screaming childes just to buy a couple sticks of buttah? 

And I understand carding, but do you really have to whip out the book to copy down my info and then make me sign my name like three times because my 16-year old self's signature doesn't match my 27 year-old scrawl? Come on, now. That's excessive. I appreciate that you think I'm looking foxy young for my age, but I'd rather hit up the crack pipe-selling liquor paloozas along McDowell than deal with this nonsense.

Unless I am in desperate need of an ingredient *stat* or require something special like their amazing Mediterranean olive selection, I'm staying far, far away.
Cafe Monarch is everything the five star reviews make it out to be and more. It's a must try for a unique brunch\/lunch\/dinner\/whatever experience in the valley! I'm reluctant to review this place since I don't want to wade through patrons on my way to another lovely Sunday brunch, but my taste buds will not be deterred. (Plus I have until September before they re-open, so there's plenty of buffer room.)

It's an impromptu fly-by-the-seat-of-whatever-the-chef-feels-like-whipping-up type place. The kind of place where you show up to breakfast and are asked one question: Sweet or savory? 

So whatever you do, leave those picky eater at home! When it comes to dinner, you don't want a wonderbread palate ("Um, I don't eat anything green...") influencing the meal. Chef Christopher is a dynamo in the kitchen, and you need to leave that one man show plenty of room to create his masterpieces. No exaggeration, his dishes are crazy delicious masterpieces. It's like having your own personal top chef customizing something just for you.

The fact that this place is BYOB makes my heart smile. I love sharing a couple bottles of good wine or champagne among friends over dinner, and the fact that I don't have to pay a restaurant mark-up is ideal. He's also cool with you brining in some orange or cranberry juice for  DIY mimosas in the morning. There's a $10 corking fee, but considering the fact that a glass of wine is often more expensive than that, it's a screaming deal. 

Be forewarned that this is a dining experience rather than a quicky meal. A much more European approach to lingering and enjoying the food, drink and atmosphere. It will take you a couple hours to get through everything from initial seat and greet with the chef (who doubles as the waiter\/busser\/todos!) to your last scrumptious bite. Totally worth every minute of waiting. Also, you might not want to come here starvin marvin. And definitely don't invite anyone you can't stomach hanging out with for a couple hours. 

Let's wrap it up:
-Don't bring picky eaters.
-Don't come so hungry that you'd eat the ass end carpaccio out of fresh roadkill.
-Don't bring socially awkward schmoes that will suck all the fun out of the room because you've got to be around that for hours, man. Hours.
-Do BYOB, and don't be afraid to bring a mixer for mimosa fun.
-Do bring cash only, and tip very, very well. (He deserves it!)

I now set you forth upon the world with the knowledge necessary to enjoy all that Cafe Monarch has to offer. Use it wisely.
This place sucks.

Now I understand that's not the most helpful assessment, so I'll elaborate to save you from ending up at this crap hole should you think, "Oh Erica, you must have just been cranky that day!" Not so.

It all started when I had a craving for hummus earlier this week. I work too far from just about every hummus slinging place in Tempe but Byblos. So I decided to try something new, and was left with a sour taste in my mouth.

First off, the place is located in a shitty plaza of decaying shops (home to the Yucca Tap Lounge if that's any indication) and it's right next door to a Mexican food restaurant that I've never seen anyone enter or leave, so it looks like a front for some shady 'business' dealings. But my craving would not be deterred by a craptastic plaza, after all, Capistrano's is in the same plaza and it's delicious. Looks aren't everything. Hummus would be had.

We enter. It's empty and dumpy looking. The only people here have a mean age of 70. We significantly bring this average down. Waaaay down. We are escorted to a table and peruse the menu. The server (I assume it's the unfriendly server you had, Kelly B., because he looked like he had a stick up his ass that had been festering there for the past 60 years) took our drink orders and came back with two itsy bitsy little cups. Seriously? You're going to charge me 2.50 for six ounces of lemonade? We order. He frowns for the umpteenth time in our short interaction and waddles off to the kitchen. The food arrives.

The hummus was straight up GROSS, and the pita bread was shockingly similar to cardboard. The hummus tasted sour with a texture that was a combination between chalk and paste. If I can corner a five year old, I'm going to conduct a taste test between the two substances and see if there's any discernable difference. My money's on no. The presentation was nice, with pickles, tomatoes, olive oil and parsley, but if I wrap a piece of dried up dog shit in ribbons and bows, your gift would still be a piece of dried up dog shit. Maybe you could use it as a paper weight? 

The tomato soup that came along with lunch was pretty decent,and the gyro meat was well spiced. But the fact that my gyro was wrapped in the aforementioned cardboard pita bread was really unappetizing. It's like they took rock hard, stale pita bread, heated it in the microwave to make it pliable, molded it and let it cool in its rigid formation. 

So if you're 70 and your senses are slowly numbing, you might like this place. Other than that, stay away. It's unwelcoming and unappetizing. The antithesis of what a restaurant should be. Let it slowly decay along with the rest of the shops lining this creepy little plaza at the corner of Mill and Southern.
It's alright. I don't get the crazed collegiate love for this tiny taco shop. Granted it's only been open for a month or so, but since it's their third location I doubt the menu will change any time in the future and that's really my gripe. 

Carne asada and al pastor pork. 

That's it. 

They'll serve it in just about any iteration of a "tortilla + meat" that Taco Bell has dreamed up six times over, but fact is you're stuck with either carne asada or al pastor.

Needless to say the meat should be mind blowing to carry such a limited menu. It was solid, but nothing to write home about. The al pastor tasted overly smoky and there was a strange tinge of sweetness underlying the pork flavor, while the carne asada was good but nothing a dozen other 'Bertos clones couldn't pound out. And I'm sorry, but $2.25 is pricey for one bitsy taco. I could almost get two tacos for the same price at my other taco dives.

The elote was also disappointing. I understand that it's "America's corn" and their spin on it, but there was zero chile or lime flavor to the corn. It was very tender but totally slathered in mayo and powdery cheese. I added some lime and chile spice with their dipping sauce, but it was still just so-so. 

I'm a taco fiend so I'm giving these guys the benefit of the doubt with three stars (when I really want to give them two). And even though I'm at ASU just about every day of the week, I can't say I see myself coming back.
I awake, wild eyed in a cold sweat, visions of caramel creme macaroons soliciting me like high class tricks in a whorehouse, Croque Monsieurs their swanky pimps, demanding payment for service. Essence strikes again. The only way to vanquish these dreams is to lunch here on a regular basis. 

I've been here twice in the past week alone and I think I'm addicted. The atmosphere, product, service, and baked goods have seduced me with their simple elegance. The only gripe I possibly have about this place is the fact that the parking lot is the size of a matchbox, and with Sacks, Cafe Lalibella and Starbucks all occupying the same plaza, finding a place to park during the busy lunch rush is like simultaneously playing Tetris and Frogger.

The atmosphere at Essence is understated in its sophistication. Windows line the majority of the dining room, creating an inviting, open air feeling and the attached patio is charming. Strong earth toned colors and cute little origami flower bouquets grace the tables. Despite the small size of the establishment there are a variety of seating options for single patrons or small groups, and I've never seen people waiting for a table, even during their busiest Friday lunch rush.

A broad array of patrons frequent Essence including hipsters, young professionals, older adults in their power suits, and even a few elders. I haven't seen very many college kids, which may because the food isn't cheap and it's probably "weirder" than options on Mill's strip. But I dig the "weird" French inspired cuisine. It's decadent and I feel naughty eating it.

Everything I've eaten during lunch has been exceptional. The croque moniseur is far and away the best thing I've tried so far. A grilled sandwich with an egg washed top layer, thin sliced ham, creamy gruyere cheese and jalapenos. It's heavenly crunchy, just as the name suggests. The open face steak sandwich is tender delicious and smothered in buttery sauteed mushrooms with a sprinkle of bleu cheese crumbles as a savory accent. The layers of phyllo dough used in the spanakopita demonstrates some serious painstaking dedication to producing a good product, and the chopped Greek salad was phenomenal. Crispy cucumbers, bell peppers, kalmata olives, feta cheese and tomatoes that tasted like, well, actual tomatoes, for once. Something that you don't often find and an indication that Essence uses amazingly fresh organic product whenever possible. Even the side of potato salad with whole grain mustard was exceptional.

The offerings at their bakery are just as phenomenal as their lunch entrees. The caramel creme macaroon is seriously the most amazing sandwich cookie I've ever tasted, a perfect harmony between savory creme filling and sweet chewy wafers. The strawberry shortcake is amazingly fresh and light, if not a little hard to eat. And their white chocolate raspberry layer cake is the classiest Little Debbie-esque snack cake I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. One day I vow to pick up a box of "Tasty little treats" just so I can sample a cupcake and about three cookies without having to choose among all the desserts on display!

I highly recommend this place. Just don't be surprised if you develop an insatiable desire to consume Essence on a daily basis.
This was a great end to a dreary rainy gloomy draining no good very bad day! 

A bottle (or two or five) of wine shared among friends, great food for us to nosh, and Thomas the quintessential host to keep the good times rolling.

And chilled Patron with fresh fruit? Why we must have left too early!
I don't know how I ended up at this place. I blame in on serious hunger-starved delusions that the Caddy Ranch may have changed for the better since my last visit.  

The food is mediocre and kind of overpriced for the fare. If you're looking to Caddy it up on the cheap, check out the lunch specials on the weekend or the happy hour deals during the week. If you discount the tchotchke TGI-Chili-Bee's atmosphere, it can be a pretty decent happy hour or football destination if that's your bag.

The appetizer sampler is on par for bar food and a pretty good deal for the price. The sliders are disappointing in terms of size and flavor, but the fries they come with are pretty tasty. Onion rings are grease-heavy and came out cold. Whatevs. The food really isn't the issue I have with this place. It's probably a two stars for the food alone, "Meh. I've experienced better."

What pushes this into the dud pile: Crap wait staff that doesn't seem to give a flying rats ass about your table. Straight up grody cocktail combinations that left us feeling like we were about to go into a sugar coma. The seedy vibe at the nightclub coupled with a cover to get in. And the fact that the mechanical bull is like, never on. The night life is really a little slice of the West Side in Tempe. As a reformed G-town resident, I really need to keep away or risk slipping back into my trash person ways.

Nyet. Nyet. Nyet. Three strikes and you're out, Caddy.
I used to be a hardcore Mamma Mia groupie, now I'm just sort of lukewarm and meh about the place. 

The wings have always sucked with a weird cloying sweetness that shouldn't be present in a vinegar dominant sauce, and they're always soggy, which is kind of a big bummer. But it's the pizza that's the big star here and I don't know if it's just me but it seems like there's been a slow but noticeable decline in its quality. Less toppings, burnt crust more often than not, cheese that seems to congeal in the five minutes it takes to go from box to mouth. They used to have a lot more hot sandwich and a drink specials too. Chicken parm, cordon bleu, meatball subs, all delicious! Just not offered with as much regularity or in as plentiful a portion as they used to be. 

Plus, and this might be a personal beef, but the drink that came with the two slices special has been scaled back to a much smaller cup. Have the extra couple gulps of soda per transaction really translated to that much of an increase in syrup costs? Is an extra six ounces of drink really hurting business?

One last point and I'll end this sigh-inducing session. The service at Mamma Mia's is really pretty crappy now. Granted it was never the friendliest pizza joint (I seriously don't get the love expressed in all these reviews, as I've never seen it), but I'm just as happy with a terse and professional transaction as I am a chatty one. Now I'm lucky to get so much as acknowledgment upon approaching the counter. Usually just a blank stare from the cashier as they wait for you to speak up, followed by the price of whatever you wanted. No "Thanks." No "It'll be just a minute." Nada. I'm pretty sure that the scowls on the counter gals are fast becoming fixed.

Don't get me wrong, I'm still going to stop by for a quick couple of slices now and then. I just don't get as excited as I used to. I used to be a super groupie! Mamma Mia! Sad days.
Half hits, half misses. (And we tried a LOT of stuff.)

Hits: 
-Soft shell crab roll. Beautiful presentation, wonderful flavor. The aioli was really nice, and the crab was fried to perfection. 
-Bacon wrapped medjool dates. YES. MORE OF THESE. ALWAYS.
-Wild mushroom tacos. So good you won't miss meat. I echo the concerns of others that they are too small for the price...but I'm willing to pay whatever you demand for more.
-Miso eggplant. Delicate and creamy. Will make a believer even out of the most ardent eggplant hater. Perfect.
-Green magic mojito. This blended drink danced on my taste buds, but if you don't like your drinks herbaceous, go for something else.

Neither here nor there: 
-Guacamole with dried fruit. Decent guac but too much lime, needed more salt and a bit of heat, tomato, or onion flavor. At 11 bucks, it should really come with a couple extra chips instead of making you shell out for more.
-Rollo Chingon. Too much guac on top, but the adobo shrimp sushi was tasty and the roll was stunning to look at. Just take some of that extra avocado topping and smear it on your lotus root chip. 
-Coconut cocktail. Serviceable, but needed something to put it over the top. Couldn't really taste the lemongrass or lime. 
-Valet. You gotta. Ain't no way around it.

Misses: 
-Crispy pork belly roll. So aggressively salty. Could taste hardly anything it was so salty. Should have listened to some of the other reviewers on here and avoided it. 
-Korean beef taco. Salt lick central. So salty you couldn't taste anything else. Really a bummer. Also not traditional Korean beef like you'd get a Korean BBQ, but shredded.
-Head on giant shrimp. Shrimp is singular in this case. And dramatically overcooked. Inconsistent seasoning, with one bite rubbery shrimp and the next almost pure salt rub. The pureed garlic and halved cherry tomatoes were pretty insipid too. Don't waste your 14 bucks on one nasty shrimp.  
-Nightclub atmosphere. So necessarily loud.
Barro's is what Digiorno wishes it could be with that rising crust crap. I swear, if I could eat Barro's every day without my arteries protesting, I would. (And could, because it's cheaper compared to other pricier options like Venezia's and Spinato's.)

The cheese is high quality, salty, melty, and they don't skimp. The crust is chewy and thick and awesome with some of those rad mega crust bubbles near the edge. The toppings are always high quality and generous. The wings are thick and juicy, deep fried to a crisp and then smothered in the perfect amount of sauce. And they deliver to me three miles away, which makes me super happy.
Attention all business owners:  Playing KYOT in your establishment may result in the automatic deduction of one star.  The aural assault of elevator music redux is an offensive to every fiber of my being.  It penetrates my ear balls and leaves me with a slight tic.  I am not the only person suffering from this affliction.  Consider yourself warned.

Other than blaring tunes to haunt my soul, the Chicago Gyro place is a rock solid choice for a mash up of Mediterranean and Chicago dawgs.  The menu is gimungous and really pretty intimidating.  Luckily I can keep chipping away at it by ordering something different each time, because the food really is pretty inexpensive.  It'll run you about six bucks for a gyro meal deal that comes with fries and a drink, and around eight for the gyro plate that comes with hummus and other deliciousness.  

My only beef, aside from the irrational hatred of Kaaay-Whhhy-Oooooh-Teeee smoooooth jaaaazz, is that the gyros are a little on the dry side and underdressed for my liking.  They are very generous with the meat here and the pitas are top notch, but they only slap, like, a single tomato slice down, and then load that madre up with onions and a tiny squirt of sauce along the bottom.  Now I appreciate a well packed gyro.  By all means, meat it up, but squirt a little of that shit on the top and side of the pita to lubricate my meat hole. (Don't go there.)  Cucumbers would also be a pleasant addition, sirs and madams. (Again, don't go there.)

Anyhoodle, I'm doling out a solid three stars.  You fill my tummy and leave me quite satisfied.
I've got some spunky glasses that try to go on adventures without me. I turn my head too quick, they take that as a cue to flap their little arms and fly off my head. I bend down to tie my shoe, they hurry to the tip of my nose for a better view. I fall asleep in them, and I'm not sure what kind of antics they get into, but I usually find them in disarray on the ground or tangled in the blankets. Maybe they just wanted to cuddle, but I'm pretty sure they're conspiring to elope to Vegas without me. 

But they're creatures of habit, so it's not too often they pull a fast one on me. (Although every time they do I'm sure they giggle their lenses off as I grope for them like a blind mole-like critter.) They recently hatched a new plan, easily the most devious of the bunch. Instead of working as a team they decided to take their chances solo and rendezvous at a meeting point. That meeting point happened to be my bathroom counter.

I set them down and *plop* what was once one piece was then two. I was so shocked that I conceded a good couple of days to them. Especially since they were willing to go to such extremes to get away from me! While they gloated over their victory I was stuck with my highly unflattering, scratched and cruddy Harry Potter glasses.

After a brief hiatus they agreed to reconcile for the sake of my nose (and my ego). So off to All-American Eyeglass Repair we went! We showed up and were promptly greeted by a young man at the counter. My glasses warmed to him immediately and I could practically hear them purring with contentment. It was an ocular spa day. 

He took my wily little friends into the back (gave 'em a quick massage), popped in a new screw (the happy ending on that massage), then tightened and re-bent (lil chiropractic work) them back into shape. 

Total cost: zero dollars and zero cents. 

My glasses must have sweet talked him while they were in the back because his only requirement was that we come back to him for all our glasses repair needs. Seeing how this is the first time in years these glasses have sat quietly in one place for longer than thirty minutes, I'm pretty sure they've put the revolution on the back burner. But the next time they start conniving, it's off to All-American Eyeglass Repair for a visit to my favorite lens masseuse!
Only ever eaten in the bar during happy hour, so this review is not for old school steak house fare with all the fixins. 

That's cool though because I can't bring myself to eat a ginormous hunk o' muscle very often anyway. I can go years without ending up in a steakhouse and when I do it's generally a meh experience regardless of how orgasmic people tell me the slice of cow is supposed to be. 

Saloon 1889 on the other hand is right up my alley. Hey, we all have our vices. 

The atmosphere is pure Arizona. It's the perfect combination between the slightly nauseating Rawhide's folksy old-Zona and the Rat Pack old school Arizona exemplified by Durant's, with maybe a dash of Monti's La Casa Mediocre tossed in for good measure. 

The bar is a massive antique-looking dark wood relic from another era, with ornate pillars and a huge gilded mirror along one side. The bartenders also look like they could whip you up a classic cocktail, the stuff with bitters, or a girly sugar bomb. They got skills. 

The happy hour is really where's it's at here. Free sliders, chips and salsa. Couple bucks off the bar bites, which are substantial meal replacements. Cheap wine, well, beer, all delivered with a smile.
This place really doesn't need another review, but seeing how it's my home away from home, I feel obliged to speak up from the peanut gallery.

I adore this joint as both a bar and a restaurant. It has the best patio in all of Tempe, nay all of Phoenix, no--history. Alright, probably not history. I mean, if there were a bar in the middle of some wicked beautiful natural reserve, I'm sure it would trump Casey's. But I'm not qualifying their worth based on beauty. (Sorry, dearest. I'll make sure to spend freely this weekend to make up for that slight.) The five stars it gets is based on the general relaxing vibe it exudes.

It's far enough off the Mill Avenue strip that the douchebaggery of those bars rarely flows over into Casey's. I've seen that the only gripe most people have with this bar is the occasional frat boy that wanders onto the patio, but even though these specimens in their natural environment are prone to swinging their dicks and strutting with impunity, they act different once they're surrounded by the regular clientele. The regulars could care less that you're the beer pong champion or top sorority sex kitten, can you engage in a meaningful conversation? No? Then kindly take your bulging biceps and stilettos to Scottsdale, where you're sure to be appreciated.

I love the fact that this bar attracts such a broad range of people, all of whom coexist in an atmosphere of mutual respect and happy drunkenness. The elderly come here for the oysters, the hipsters come here to show off their newest tattoo. ASU professors coexist with high school dropouts. Professional bar hoppers chit chat with weekend warriors. The food's pretty wicked as well. 

French onion soup, the Hippie Sandwich, the Tuna Bacon Melt, the Fishwich (without bread it just becomes fish and chips, but way cheaper), the Oysters Rockefeller, the Chipotle Chicken Wings, the Clamstrip basket at 5 bucks a pop...it's greasy and divine. The prices aren't absurd, but are a little on the steep side for bar food, but it's totally worth it. And if you go for happy hour, there are free munchies inside near the dart board.

It's a lovely little pub with a great patio, friendly servers and decent drink prices. Go there often enough and I'm sure its subtle charm will capture your fancy (and your wallet), just as it has countless others.

Dearest Casey Moore, you hold a place in my heart and although my liver denies it, she thinks you're pretty cool too.
I'm not drinking the kool aid. 

Sure the vegan spinach and artichoke dip and many types of hummus are amazing, that's what Dr. Hummus and Co does very, very well. They made their name on the farmers market circuit and deserve props for making consistent, solid hummus and dips. It's just too bad they didn't just stick to that.

The soups and salads failed to impress. Either woefully lacking or overly aggressive in flavor, which means there's a quality control issue because no kitchen would send product out if it tasted that off. The GLT was pretty good, mainly because of the awesome spinach and artichoke dip slathered on thick.

To top it all off, you're paying serious farmer market prices. Everything is about 20 percent more expensive that it has any right to be. (Go check out Munch A Lunch on the other side of Tempe for a cheap, humble Mediterranean lunch joint that exceeds where Herb N Flavor fails.) 

Stick to a counter-ordering system for sandwiches. With cheap IKEA decor and only three tables full at lunch time, there's no need for four waitstaff to be wandering around aimless and looking for something, anything, to do. Payroll is way higher than it should be.

Which is why they're charging three bucks for a glass of iced tea. Or eight bucks for a thin slather of spinach and artichoke dip on a platter when I could buy a whole tub of the stuff for the same price. And then I have to tip a luckluster waitstaff on top of everything? I walked out 45 bucks lighter and seriously unimpressed.

Y'all can keep it. If I'm going to frequent a small business with an awkward name, I'll head across the street to Beaver Choice in the future.
The BEAST! Embrace it. 

The Beast is what you call the divey bar off to the right with pool tables and a killer jukebox. Full bar, full menu. Open late.

If you don't know, now you know.
Even though I've already professed the fact that I don't mind waiting awhile in order to consume the delicious breakfast foods at Matt's, I certainly don't mind a little diversion from the usual stand around, chit chat, look at other customer's yummy food, wish I had some, get some water instead, sigh. 

The Downtown Phoenix Public Market is the perfect diversion from this routine! There are a wide variety of stands, especially considering it's such a small market, and there aren't that many tchotchke arts and craft offerings to be had. Just a couple candles and soap stands that are dominated by a lot of fresh and organic edibles. 

Some of the stands offer little samples of their wares, which of course I had to take advantage of. I had a sip of Hansen's orange creme soda, some iced tea, organic hummus with a pita chip and some interesting roasted Mexican seeds that the Aztecs used to cultivate. Those salty, crisp treats made a satisfying pop when I bit 'em, tasting nutty and delicious. Almost bought a bag. Thought better of it when I saw the guy selling baklava.

A small portion of baklava and kataifi was my only purchase, both of which were decadent sweet treats later on after lunch. The layered phyllo dough, the piles of nuts, the honey slathered on thick! It was divine. At 4 bucks for these two tiny squares, it wasn't the best bang for my buck, but the taste totally made up for the size, and when it's that orgasmicly good, size doesn't matter, go ahead and ask anyone. I was also tempted to pick up some pickled asparagus and some jalapeno jelly. Just for kicks.

There was a pretty good live folksy musical act when I was there too, so check out the entertainment if you happen to be in the area. And if you're stuck on a Saturday behind ten other groups vying for the butter soaked goodness of Matt's Big Breakfast, this little market is small enough that you can walk the entire extent of the lot, try all the samples they offer, and make it back to the corner of 1st and McKinley before your party is called.
Prankster's really isn't anything extraordinary, just a run of the mill dive bar, but I like the dives of Tempe. One of the reasons is the fact that it's unlikely you'll encounter Frankie Frat puffing out his chest in a courtship ritual to attract the ever preening Suzie Sorority.  This kind of bar act as repellent for those college aged kiddos. 

It might have something to do with the fact that it's really dark inside, illuminated by a couple lights and the glow of massive televisions that consume an entire wall of the bar. Nobody can possibly appreciate the hours it took to gel your hair just right or admire a brand new manicure in this cave-like atmosphere, but me and my low maintenance kind find it just peachy.

The decor is unimaginative and functional, while the bathrooms...well, the toilets work and that's really all I'm looking for.  I remember that I came to the same 'epiphany' as Lauren V. half way through my first visit, "Ooooh, it's called Prankster's because they flipped all the signs upside down! What wild and crazy jesters! I better keep my eye on them or my potato skins might just be served upside down too!" Then I laughed heartily in a condescending manner and went back to sipping my way into a solid drunk.

Which is what it basically boils down to for me: cheap drinks and trivia. I'll play some buzztime trivia for hours on a boring weekend afternoon, or until they switch to a sports category, then I just want to throw my controller at the screen. These impulses increase in turn with the number of drinks I consume. 

They've got a pretty big menu as well, which is a nice offering. It's just bar food, not some transcendent culinary delight, but it's decent. Don't get the chili though. Waaaay too earthy with all the cumin they add, to the point where it tastes like you're eating chili beans coated in dirt. I may have made a mean mud pie when I was younger, but those days are now behind me. If you go, get the nachos or the Hot Spot sandwich. Both are stellar. Not too many other things come even close.
Solid three stars. The menu is "globally inspired" but still manages to come off as little more than another New American restaurant riding on its gluten-free, veg 'n' vegan laurels. If you think Pei Wei is "globally inspired" good eats, you'll probably dig True Foods. Or if you're looking for a place to take even the pickiest of eaters be they bland food lovers or gluten-lactose intolerant vegetarians.

Tip 1: Beware the nouveau health guru buzz words on the menu. 

Enjoyed the ginger carrot elixir, thought the pomegranate juice was mega overpriced, and why? Because of the omg!antioxidants? Potatoes have freakin' antioxidants but I'm not about to drink a tater slurry.

Tip 2: The food is chain-restaurant quality.

The apps are fairly meager and like everything else on the menu, too expensive for what you get. Hummus comes with a couple measly pita triangles, so make sure to ask for more. The caramelized onion tart is another small but tasty option to share between two people.

The TLT (tempeh, lettuce, and tomato) was a major bummer. The tempeh was cold and hard to bite through, the bread was so dry it tore up the roof of my mouth, and they left off the avocado and mayo. Bison burger was much more moist but practically fell apart upon first bite, so make sure you got a knife and fork at the ready. The kale salad and sweet potatoes are the bomb though. Consider just getting 'em solo to avoid a lackluster entree.

Tip 3. Your food will take freakin' forever to get to you.

The service is obsequious and annoying, but also manages to come off as condescending, impersonal, and rushed? WTH? Doubly annoying since the food usually takes a loooong time to reach your table.
Having lived in Mesa and delivered sub sandwiches to some of the tweekiest of tweakers, I don't feel any shame in admitting that whole area now resides in a dead zone for me. When I get that itch to go out and tear up the town, waste away a lazy afternoon, or enjoy a nice dinner, I think of places north, south and west of Tempe. It's like my brain has one of those little electric dog collar things attached to it, and when I start to stray too far east, it gives me a subliminal zap so I erase Mesa from the map in my mind.

So naturally, Stray Cats is usually a place I visit when meeting up with others who have suggested it. 

Thing is, I always end up having a pretty good time when I go there. The drinks are priced reasonably and generally on the strong side, the bartenders are friendly and quick to serve. The music is pretty good, but I've never been here when a DJ's spinning. I used to like the fact that there was an air conditioned smoking room off to the side with plush couches and big televisions. The crowd is always diverse, friendly and easy to engage in slurred conversation.

It just doesn't have any special oomph for me. I'd much rather frequent Hollywood Alley a couple miles south, where there's pool and live music. Unfortunately it's also on the black list of Mesa, so maybe I should find a way to reverse that programming. It's not just tweakers and mormans, it's not just tweakers and mormons, it's not just tweakers and mormons....
If you haven't been here. Go. Now. Stop reading this review, ignore the fact that you just ate an hour ago, and go nosh the shit out of some of the best damn chicken you'll find in the valley. 

There are only two options at this place that are on par with some of the best carne asada or red chicken you'll get from a carniceria. Seeing how the only options are chicken or beef (Or both! Go wild!), it's probably not the best place to bring a leaf eater. They'll be stuck munching on marinated onions, since I'm pretty sure the tortillas and pinto beans have got a lovely amount of lard in them, plus their senses will be assaulted by the delicious smell of succulent, juicy grilled meat. That smell by the way can be detected throughout the strip mall this place is located in, and without a fail gets me salivating whenever I walk by. 

Everything is prepared lightening fast and you can eat in the place or get your food to go. The combos are dirt cheap and delicious, at four bucks for a 1\/4 beef or chicken, and seven bucks for the combination of the two. Each combo comes with two torillas, pinto beans, salsa and maninated onions. Half and whole chickens or piles of beef are also available for extremely reasonable prices. They only take cash though, so run over to the Circle K at Ash and University to the money machine if you find yourself with nothing but plastic. The 2.00 fee to use the ATM will be totally worth it.
Cheeburger, Cheeburger!

It's a restaurant called Cheeburger, Cheeburger!!

The little kid in me squealed with delight. 

Like pasghetti and sammiches, cheeburgers are one of those willfully mispronounced foodstuffs that bring back a little nostalgia. They remind me of those rare days when we'd all pile in my chain smoking babysitter's Caddy and cruise to McD's for cheeburgers, cheapo happy meal toys, and a romp in the pee covered ball pin. 

Urine, second hand smoke, and cheeburgers. I couldn't fathom a better combination at that age.

Then again we didn't have Cheeburger, Cheeburgers when I was a kid. If we did I'd be eating my kid's meal out of a super sweet pink hot rod that looks almost identical to the Barbie mobile, sippin' my hand shaken soda and munchin' on a cheeburger, American, ketchup. I'm in my twenties but I still wanted one of those little card stock car boxes, even if my taste in toppings has become a bit more adventurous.

Just because my tastebuds have matured doesn't make me any more decisive now than I was then. Not a good thing with a place that boasts 50 or so toppings for you burger (or chicken sandwich, or salad-- they're all based on the same "every order is a special order" model). I didn't even attempt to figure out what kind of fancy pants shake or soda flavor I wanted (100 flavors, people! 100!!) and just kept it simple with a glass of water in a mason jar. The fries vs. onion rings debate was also too heated, but a basket of crisp and delicious frings came to the rescue. The onion rings were thin and lightly battered, definitely the better of the two options, and the fries were fresh cut and uber greasy, just how I like 'em, even if they were under-salted.

In the end I went with a Classic green chile cheddar burger with the traditional fixins (lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, mustard, ketchup). It was cooked to a perfect medium and the price was right, ringing in at about 5 bucks. I agree that the top bun was way too big in comparison to the bottom, but I solved that by shaving half of it off so I could wrap my mouth around that thick slab of meat, because let's face it people, the bun is just filler. It's all about the meat. It was messy and juices were dripping all over my face, and I must have gone through at least four paper towels, but hot diggity damn, it was a great burger.

The smallest burger possible (the Classic) is about five ounces or so and they increase incrementally until you reach the big mamba jamba 20 ounce 'nother nail in the coffin coronary on a bun. I can't even guess how many pieces of cheese it takes to cover that beast. I did however witness two people finish this outrageous burger while I was enjoying my dainty (by comparison) fare. Both gastric champions had their pictures taken with a gigando stuffed cheeburger (I would have worn it as a hat), and then had their image pasted on the wall of shame...err...fame.

My inner child's parting words are: "Cheeburger! Cheeburger! Go eat cheeeeeburgerrrrrs!"

My more mature counterpart: "Ahem, a myriad of combinations are possible between burgers, shakes and sides, variety enough to satisfy even the most discerning of palates and leave everyone...CHEEBURGER!!!"

P.S. Fuck Red Robin in its bony little chicken wing. This place is miles ahead of that bland dump.
Why did you leave me? I feel adrift in a world without good Szechuan. Everywhere I go puts a stupid amount of cornstarch in their sauces. Come back please.
I'm a non-traditional girlfriend, so I always forget what's expected of me during conventional gift giving holidays like Valentine's Day. And this year I totally neglected to get Mr. Man so much as a card. Dog house! (I thought we weren't celebrating! How was I to know that little sneaker was would bring a smile to my face with a cutesy, cheesy, tchotchky gift and card combo?)

Little did he know that I had an ace up my sleeve. An ace with lots and lots of titacular action. Bombshells! I know that nothing brings a smile to Mr. Man's face quicker than a pair of boobies, so we stopped by on Sunday for some sinful indulgence in an illusionary atmosphere. Being a non-traditionalist doesn't have to be a bad thing.

Sundays are 2 for 1 well drinks and domestic bottles before 7 pm, which is nice when it's $7.75 for a short gin and tonic. There's also no cover, an indication that Sunday nudity lures some guys that are reminiscent of your dad. Expect gentlemen in kahki shorts and button down shirts paying to have a lady rub their bits all over. But at least these gents are better business than the twenty-somethings that just watched the entire time, not a dollar bill in sight. Skeeze. 

It's pretty easy to see which girls are enjoying themselves up there (or at least doing a good job faking it) and who's bored as all get out. We had some very enthusiastic ladies, especially after the shift change at 6pm, and they totally knew how to work the pole in their seven inch heels. Don't come here expecting tig ole fake bitties you usually encounter at Skin or other Scottsdale places. These ladies are au natural and I wouldn't have it any other way. 

What's nicest was this fact that they're willing to sit down and chat with you regardless of whether you're interested in a lap dance or not:
Lovely buxom brunette: "What are you and your girlfriend celebrating?"
Mr. Man: *baffled, blank stare* "Sunday?"
LBB: "Wow! She's a keeper. Hold on to that one!"

Officially out of the dog house.

It's not a brusque, all-business attitude at Bombshells and even though I was the only girl there that wasn't on shift (aside from an awkward couple that came in scowling, stayed for three songs and booked it), there's no awkwardness about it. And since I'm a woman I get the supremely sexy treatment instead of the perfunctory titty shake when I tip.

The icing on our lecherous evening? Mr. Man got a lap dance and the Italian beauty offered to do a couple's one for no extra charge. Now that's class. 

Maybe I'm too harsh on the whole 'tradition' thing. Let's make this Anti-Valentine's Day of Debauchery a regular occurrence.
I am a hummus fiend. I have made tabbouleh so delicious that the heavens parted and rained down tears of joy upon its consumption. I will cut a bitch over the last dollop of garlic dip. Don't even get me started on baba ghanoush.

So it's almost a guarantee that I will like anything that draws upon a Mediterranean flavor palate. 

Med Fresh is no exception.

It's technically Turkish, but I don't split hairs when it comes to Mediterranean. The pitas are fresh and flavorful, the tzatziki is kickin' and the gyro meat (beef and chicken) are always moist and delicious. Everything is prepared as you order it and you have a clear view of the goings-on in the sunken kitchen. The staff can be a bit terse at times but they're always professional and quick to disperse a busy lunch rush. 

The platters are priced well for the mound of food you receive, and while I have had some tonsil-scraping dry chicken on occasion, the majority of the time the kabobs and koftas are moist and tender. If you simply can't be pressed to make up your mind, go with the mixed grill and get a bit of a variety. 

The pita sammich special (#16) is the best bang for your buck on the menu. Pita, meat, tomato, lettuce, weird pickles and secret sauce. Served with tzatziki and their killer spicy red sauce. Salad or fries on the side. $6.95. 

Oh yeah.
Man, did anyone else get hit by that powerful hail-tastic burst of heavy rain yesterday? I was driving to Carlsbad Tavern when the clouds unleashed buckets upon buckets of rain on my car. By the time I got there the rain had subsided to a drizzle and it made for the absolute perfect atmosphere as I walked up the wooden planks into the cave-like atmosphere of Carlsbad Tavern.

But then I looked to the right and saw an empty lagoon with tchotchke plastic turtles and fish upended and scattered atop PVC pipes in the concrete enclosure. I can accept the fact that they wouldn't keep that filled during the summer though. It's a waste of water with all the evaporation, although I'd really like to come here when the waterfall moat thingy is functioning because it looks like it would be great ambiance for a fun dinner!

I got there 15 minutes late and ended up having to wait another 15 minutes for my mom and aunt to arrive (what can I say, we're a punctual family). So I sauntered up to the bar and ordered a margarita on the rocks with salt. Since it was on happy hour it cost me only $3.75 and was a smooth combination of tequila, triple sec and sweet and sour mix. For only four bucks this well concoction was one of the better margaritas in recent memory. Chile pepper lights around the bar with all sorts of bat related memorabilia managed to be campy fun rather than campy trashy and gave me plenty to observe as I was waiting.

Feeling like the traditional Mexican munchies, I ordered the tricolor chips with two salsas. This was an unfortunate choice. The salsa de casa was very coarsely chopped, which made it really hard to dip or spoon onto a chip, and was extremely heavy on tomatoes with few other discernable flavors. The tomatillo salsa tasted okay but was also chopped so coarsely it was like layering strips of tomatillo on chips. The chips weren't too bad, but they were reminiscent of oil they've been using to crisp chimichangas in for the past week. I've worked in food service and I know what old oil tastes like.

But the conversation with my aunt and mom more than made up for the disappointing appetizer, and it cost two whopping bucks so I totally got what I paid for, although it is a little disappointing that they don't come complimentary.

Once we were seated in the main dining room, I was pleased by the atmosphere and decor (stuffed bats hanging from the ceiling! high seat booths with comfy cushions! cool copper light fixtures! rock walls and a huge floor to ceiling rock feature with vegetation!), which managed to maintain a cave-like atmosphere while still being inviting. We placed our order with a very friendly server that was a natural at making small talk and joking around, instead of coming off as peeved that we were taking too long to examine The Daily Guano. I also liked the more open ended, "Is there anything I can do for you?" Rather than the usual leading questions like, "Can I get you something to drink? Do you know what you want to eat?"

I ordered the Enchantment Platter so I could try a little bit of everything, a chicken enchilada, carne adovada burrito, a chile rellano and a sopapilla. When it came out I was pretty disappointed by the presentation. It was smothered in so much sauce and cheese that it was difficult to discern just what the hell I had on my plate and it looked like my burrito had anointed the surrounding items with a liberal splash of greasy red sauce. It most definitely could have done with two plates instead of just one. 

(I'll admit it. It really, really pissed me off. That gut reaction made me want to rate this place around 2 stars instead of 4. I have issues with food presentation. I rearrange every sandwich I order at a restaurant to ensure even distribution of ingredients. I don't care if things are touching and mixing it up, but it better be doing so in an aesthetic manner.)

But once I dug in it turned out to be a delicious meal! The chicken enchilada with tomatillo and green chile was deliciously cheesy with huge chunks of chicken. The carne adovada was tender but relied a bit too heavily on some weird tomato flavor that was thickened with what tasted like cornstarch, solo it was weird, but when the burrito entrails leaked all over the place it added a delicious flavor to the meal. The chile rellano was pure pork and cheese, a dense and delicious concoction nested atop rice and black bean. Rice was generic, black beans were delish. And I've got enough leftovers for three lunches, all for only $12.95! 

Psst! Don't get the habenero burger unless you want to shit fire for the next week. I've heard that from so many people that it must be true! It's not served with a complementary glass of milk for no reason...
What kind of backasswards place still clings to a "Cash Only" policy?
A.) Dive bars that can't be trusted to give you a clean glass, but can be trusted to offer a complimentary sprinkle of crabs on the toilet seat.
B.) Wholesome off the radar entertainment, cash up front, that may also give you crabs. Sinner.
C.) Cruddy breakfast diners trying to instill an aura of the "greatest generation." Why I remember a time back before that newfangled in-ter-net contraption when I had to walk uphill both ways in waist deep snow to... Those demon harpies are trying to steal your identity! Where's my pants?!
D.) All of the above.

Ding! Time's up. Pencils down. 

Original Pancake House, did you answer D? No? You just bubbled in a smiley face on your scantron sheet? Well why not change your answer now, just a little substitute. Oh you charge a minimum of a dollar for any substitute or deviation from your menu. That's straight up retarded. I'm relegating you to the short bus for the remainder of term.

I see that you also have a tiny clause that states you're at liberty to add an 18% gratuity to any order. How very sneaky of you to not define the terms of that. So you're a trouble maker too? I'll be keeping my eye on you.

A strict "No Cellphones" policy? Interesting idea, but the place is so obnoxiously loud that I don't see the cause for such a stipulation, and since we only saw our waitress in passing, I can't fathom that it's out of respect for her. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't think you've fully developed that theme. Rework that passage and turn it back in by Monday for full credit.

That brings me to my next point, OPH. It's a great idea to have a wide variety of friends, from brodogs and scottstiudes to old folks and families out for brunch. It's really nice to see you making an effort to make everyone feel included, but your waitstaff, they're crappy, hon. Terse, perfunctory, and cold, like little automatons they whir around the restaurant. Order. Better hope you don't need anything else. Human feelings are not programmed into their model. Eat. Now get out. There are people waiting for your seat. Repeat.

And what gives you the gall to think you can charge $4.25 for three pieces of dinky bacon? OPH, I'm really disappointed in you. Since you don't allow any substitutions and since none of your entrees come with any sides (aside from massive amounts of carb-y, bland pancakes), you're practically forcing people to order certain menu items a la carte. Your food is overpriced as it is. Breakfast for two cost us 35 bucks, and we didn't even get that much food. For shame. I'm assigning you Saturday detention for the remainder of the month. Maybe that'll teach you some respect.

Now let's move on to your coursework. The food that you delivered was actually quite good. I had the Eggs Michael (even though I would have liked to substitute Canadian bacon, I couldn't justify the ridiculous extra charge on an already pricey entree) with four thin potato pancakes. The yolks of the poached eggs created a lovely little dipping sauce, the sausage beneath it jujitsu'd my taste buds to smithereens with its awesomosity, and the English muffin base was crispity and delicious. The accompanying mushroom sauce...what is the term you kids use today...sucked big dangly donkey balls. A flavorless white sauce with canned mushroom floating around looking bored with their lot in life. I can't justify cream sauce unless it's good, and your gravy sucked those donkey balls blue, OPH. The potato pancakes more than made up for the crappy sauce though. Thin little hashbrown patties with sour cream and applesauce! Yum!

Mr. Man ordered the spinach crepes with a side order of homefries and redonkulously overpriced bacon. The homefries were the only stand out aspect of that meal. The spinach filling was soggy, had more tasteless canned mushrooms filler (even came complete with the bland mushroom dipping crap) and I could taste none of the cheese you claimed was there. Quite disappointing, OPH. You did your homework at the last minute on that one, didn't you?

It's clear that you have potential. However since your grade is cumulative, I'm going to have to give you a C. Tut, tut, tut, no complaining. You earned it.
Confession time, I don't really like barbeque. It's sweet and vinegary and weird and ruins perfectly good smoked meat. But the last two times I've been out for this kind of food, I have been pleasantly surprised. Maybe as I age my appreciation for tangy tomato sugar paste matures. I'm a classy broad like that. Or maybe I just need to frequent places that know how to serve up barbeque right, and that's exactly what Urban Campfire does.

They couldn't have chosen a better location for the restaurant, within walking distance of the University, and I'm wicked pleased that nasty fucking Greasy Tony's finally crawled into its dingy little hole and died. I don't even want to know how much cleaning they had to undertake in order to reincarnate the tiny little shithole as a sparkling and inviting little diner. 

After swinging by this little place on a Monday night to see it closed, I was bummed and a little skeptical that it would be open at 8:00 on a Sunday evening. The neon sign was beckoning me to enter, but the chairs had already been stacked against the front windows and it looked like they were doing the ohgodit'sslowpleasecanwegohome prolonged breakdown, so Mr. Man went and peeked his head in to inquire if they were still able to do a take out order. Oh yeah, it was smoked meat time. 

The menu had all sorts of delicious sounding sandwiches and the barbeque staples, and most of it was heavy on the meat, so keep the veg heads away from this butcher shop or they'll be forced to nibble on the sides. The server couldn't have been more personal and engaging as we chatted about the menu offerings and details about the new place. After listening to her recommendations I ended up going with the pulled pork sandwich with beans for $7.95, while Mr. Man got the half rack of ribs with beans and fries. 

She was chatting up a storm with us about how good the food was and even gave us a sample of their special of the day, Sloppy Joes, which was bangin'! I had no idea sloppy joes could possibly shake their Manwich stigma, but the meat was tender and spiced just right and I can't even explain it. It was off the hook good and it was a fucking spoonful of sloppy joes. I still can't wrap my head around it. 

Once our orders were up we trotted home and dug into massive amounts of mouthwatering good barbeque. The sauce wasn't overly vinegary or tomatoey or sweet, and all the flavors complemented one another and lovingly embraced my porky goodness. Three huge sliders were included in my order, the buns were soft as marshmallow fluff and the beans, oh, the beans! Crispy little strips of bacon high fived my beanie little friends to double team the flavor factor. The ribs were HUGE and were definitely the stand out entree ordered. They were smoked on the premises, nicely charred and melt off the bone tender. The dogs agree with me, even though they just got the bones. Beware the french fries. They're limp since they're freshly cut and fried. But they were smothered in fresh garlic, so I found a way to overlook that little deterrent. 

They also have a ton of drink specials, from the tried and true bottle of domestic brew to funky flavored sangrias. And although I didn't try it, their dessert is a haystack cookie made of pretzel sticks, mini marshmallows, peanut butter and butterscotch sauce and they sound like something I would have made when I was too young to use the stove so I was dependent on the microwave for making chex mix and shit on a shingle. (I had a Jell-o cook book as a kiddo and tried just about every recipe in there, including the nasty mixed vegetables suspended in unflavored gelatin and beef stock. Weird.) They're also in the process of creating a patio out front where you can enjoy a picnic like atmosphere with the food to complement it. 

So I guess I have to revise my opening statement. I'm a recovering barbeque-phobe, and this cheap as sin, make me groan with pleasure barbeque joint will definitely be worked into the regular rotation.

Since I haven't eaten there more than once, I'm giving it four stars, but if it continues to be this awesome, it'll be a five star joint for me!
Doc & Eddy's is the crappy high school party for the non-high school crowd. It's uncomfortable and a little depressing, but if you repeat the ritual often enough it becomes a tolerable way to spend the evening. You just have to bring your own friends and take advantage of the cheap beer, because it's better with a buzz.

Don't believe me? Let's think back to the dusty basement\/garage\/rec room that you and all your buddies used to hang out in during high school. If you had friends with money there were ping pong tables, air hockey, pool tables or video games. Of if your friends were more like mine, a TV with rabbit ears. (Doc & Eddy's is the kid with all the cool shit you never had, even though you volunteered to use the pool table as a bed in between games to save space.)

Invariably the furniture had been cast off by surrounding rooms, relegating it to its current purgatory where collapsed cushions, cracked upholstery and wobbly tables may have mingled with bar stools and high tables, the occasional uncomfortable folding chair thrown in for the asshole that shows up unexpectedly and doesn't have anywhere to sit. Incandescent lights shone down on your little domestic beer swilling group and the walls were barren of adornment because you were too cheap to go buy some crap posters to put up over the yellowing wall paper, and mom didn't like nail holes in her dry wall. (Kinda crappy 70s seating. Nicely played, Doc.)

But you're pretty much the big shit because your parents are out of town, so you invite all your friends over and hope that some cool older kids come too. But that doesn't happen. (Cuz Eddy's at the bar acting like a skeeze.)

The creepy old dude that still likes hanging out with high school kids is staring down your cleavage chuckling with his douchewad buddies and declaring with aplomb, "Nice boobs!" The jocks are all playing beer pong or clustered around a TV yelling defensive plays at the screen, convinced that the more animated they get the more cred they'll earn with their meat head buddies. A gaggle of girls will descend upon the party later in the evening since they spent an hour getting their hair just right. They'll be wearing makeup that they applied more like spackle and dress in skin tight clothing that advertises every curve, muffin top and camel toe. 

Someone will puke in the bathroom. Some other folks will get all surly and square off or shoot each other bitch eyes for the rest of the night. And you'll end up with something broken, adding to the overall depressing air of the dilapidated rec room.

But you'll do it all again next weekend.

That is Doc & Eddy's.
When I hit a quarter of a century in years, I decided to go the uncharacteristically classy route and celebrate with something chi chi and razzdango. Exchange the morning after whiskey dents and zombie flavored scratch 'n sniff composure for a posh dinner out on the town.

Now I'm gonna share a secret with y'all. I'm no gourmand. I like a fancy pants meal as much as the next, but I'm in the cheap mo fo demographic, so I don't know dick about fine dining in the Phoenix area. I rely on you Yelpers to guide me down the path of good taste when it comes to nice shit and stuff.

Cha, cha, cha.

MEDIZONA.

It even sounds fancy, and I'm convinced it should be said with jazz fingers and maybe some light orchestral flare.

An upscale, Mediterranean-Southwestern fusion restaurant?

Intriguing.

Rabbit and fig baklava atop a pomegranate balsamic reduction, topped with a quail egg and surrounded by crispity parsnip curls?

Wicked fricken good.

It puts fig newtons everywhere to shame. Layers of airy, buttery phyllo filled with tender shredded fig and rabbit would have been much too sweet solo, but the addition of a tart reduction grabbed that figgy sweetness and tangoed round my palate! Although I'm convinced that the quail egg was just intended to be a cute little hat for the baklava. Whatevs. At least now I can claim that psh, yeah I've had quail egg before, no biggie.

Wild caught halibut with chorizo potato cake, haricot verts and carrots with orange caper cream sauce?

Melt in my mouth delicious.

Try to sneak a nibble of chorizo potato cake from my plate and I will fork you. Hard. You might pull back something a little stumpy. That was the most delectable little nibblet on the plate. The fish was super flaky and buttery, although the sauce was forgettable. And I think it's pretentious and hoity toity to call green beans "haricot verts." Merde!

Roast loin of lamb, moussaka tart, mashed taters, celery root, mint oil, and roasted red pepper sauce?

Eh. 

The lamb was ordered medium rare and prepared to perfection. Mint oil should be mandatory garnish for all baby lambs. Make em prance around the field wearing mint garlands until they're led to slaughter, where said garland will be compressed into the requisite drizzle of mint oil. Or something like that. Everything else on the plate was served cold though. Blech.

The service was impeccable, the patrons gripe worthy. Our waiter was well informed and personable, although he disappeared half way through the meal, was replaced and we never saw him again, which was kinda weird. 

The customers he was serving were pretty inconsiderate. There was a huge party of people with kids rip roaring around the restaurant off in the side room. The waiter apologized on their behalf, stating that it was an abnormal night and that kids didn't normally frequent the place, and at least they left soon after that. I don't go out to listen to the rip roar of impatient ankle biters. Instant plus two for the atmosphere as soon as they left.

But then a large group of older patrons came in and bitched about how they couldn't read the menus because it was too dark, so they turned up the lights, bent the atmosphere over the side of a chair and fucked it hard.

So I think I'm going to be a downer on the super streak Medizona's having and only give it a four. It's good but I don't think I'd ever go back. Too many other fancy schmancy restaurants waiting in the wings for an opportunity to knock my socks off. No need to return.
I've been going to the Roosevelt since just after it opened, and I'm extremely pleased to see how it's blossomed into such a lovely little bar with excellent patronage. My little boy's all growed up!

I have one reason that is the indisputable, unassailable, golden rationale for why you should visit the Roosevelt: SHARK BEER! So important it deserves both capitalization and idolization.

Distilled from the finest aquatic varieties and banned in all fifty states, its pale gold, opaque frothiness will lull you into a happy state of drunkenness and sociability. The Great White Northern is by far the finest beer to ever pass these lips. I've had the wine on occasion, but compared to the deliciosity that is Shark Beer, my only recollection is that it doesn't suck.

I regrettably haven't had the full Roosevelt experience, as I've never spent any moolah on the food there. Well, Mr. Man did order the four dollar peanuts once and I tried them. Yes. Four dollars. For a pile of peanuts. Weird thing is he thought they were worth every penny. Granted, they were huge, warm and tasty, but they're fucking four dollar peanuts! Aside from that, I've heard from a fair number of people that the food is delectable and worth the price, but I've never been in the munching mood here. 

Happy hour is undoubtedly the best time to visit this little bastion of class and comfort in downtown Phoenix, and every time I have been here at this hour the bar has been packed with well dressed and business casual folks. Evenings are a bit more intimate with fewer people, but you're pretty much guaranteed a seat somewhere, or if you come with a group of friends (that's my shout out to the lovely Yelpers I met here recently!) there is ample space for your group to socialize.

When you go, check out the funky little door in the central room above the bathroom corridor, and then tell me just where you think it leads or what they're hiding up there. Is it a portal to another dimension? Do they keep some red headed stepchild up there? Or is this where people who try to skip out on their tabs are detained? The mystery brings my overactive imagination great joy. I also dig the naked lady checking out a passing train picture in the restroom, which is like, big enough to entertain company in.

My one gripe is that they keep it cold as a meat locker in there, and my little toesies need dethawing in the Arizona heat after I exit the building. And this pithy reason's got nothing on the Roosevelt. (And the SHARK BEER.)
I'm clearly more of a Food City consumer than an AJ's gal, but this place succeeds in making me feel like I not only can, but should splurge on a five dollar loaf of bread to go with the homemade soup I just whipped up for pennies. I can deal with the prices because this place is perfect for the occasional uber-specialty ingredients that I can't get anywhere else. Edible flowers for crystallizing, espresso powder for my meat rubs, fancy pants mushrooms, high quality chocolate, duck fat, mangosteens outside of an Asian grocer, the works. 

It's also really great for picking up a couple of super fancy high end shots of liquor in the airplane bottles. Perfect for a cheapazoid like me that wants the occasional dash of St. Germain or Chambord but sure as hell isn't going to buy the whole bottle!

I've never encountered any sass here from any of the staff either, even when I show up looking like a barely thrown together trash person.
I only ever do this place for take out when I'm in the area, or if I'm looking for something special like congee. If you have not had congee yet, do it. It's awesome rice porridge. (Don't do the thousand-year-old egg though, it is interesting, but not nearly as awesome.) 

I had my hopes high after hearing so many good things from long term Phoenicians in the valley that love, love, love this place. Oh, how the mighty have fallen. Or just kinda settled. 

And you know what, it's okay to settle some nights of the week. 

Not every night can be a mighty! flavor! explosion! If that was the case then Pei Wei and Panda Express would have gone out of business years ago. Fuck it. I'm giving an extra star out just for not being a tepid commercialized variation of salty brown sauce plus rice. In yo' face, Pan-Asian corporate "cuisine." 

The prices are right, the food is piping hot, and the menu is extensive. A perfectly adequate option for Chinese take-out.
After getting my first dog from the pound (Mr. Watson, the monocle-wearing schnauzer miz) I had a voucher for a free vet visit on the City as part of the deal. This place is right in the middle of my hood, so naturally we took the wee pup here for his first visit. 

We called ahead of time to make an appointment and clarify that the voucher was good for one free visit and were given the all clear. So thermometers were inserted in very awkward places and our little pup was weighed, measured, and found to be totally awesome. End of vet visit we're presented with a bill for 40 some odd bucks.

After some pretty heavy complaining that, "WTF, mate? That's not what you said on the phone," they waived the initial visitation fee and let us go on our merry way. I've cross checked the prices here with other vets to get the little booger vaccinated and sure enough, they charged for the vet visit in addition to the vaccination fees. 

Go to Blue Cross Animal Clinic down the street and they'll charge you the flat fee for the vaccine, no office visit or nothin'. Sure beats the crappy clinic at Petsmart too, where they charge the same straight fee for the vaccines and waive the vet visit. 

I do like that I'm still on their mailing list though, and get my yearly check-up reminder for my little pupperoni.
If you frequent overpriced suburban wish fulfillment adventure outlets like REI, I would recommend you avoid the Taco Nazo and hit up the Schlotzskys instead. That way you can pay in excess of ten dollars for a mediocre meal to be consumed in a lively atmosphere, the perfect compliment to REI. 

Leave Taco Nazo to us trash people that enjoy kick ass pork, pickled carrots, gigando delicious tortillas and as much flavorful (but not scorching) squeezy bottle hot sauce as our gullets can handle. 

This place is in the weekly lunch rotation for me and my lunch crew, who generally show up coated in a thick layer of dust, dirt under the fingernails and salt crusted sweat stains pretty much all over. Nobody ever bats an eye. And if you're lucky you can get some cheap produce from folks hawking their wares out of their pickup beds out front.

Arrive hungry, horf down a burrito, and leave satisfied. What more do you need?
You want a monster sandwich that will challenge the hunger of even the burliest man? Go order a Dagwood from Gandolfo's deli. It's roast beef, turkey, ham, pastrami, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, mayo, spicy mustard, salt and pepper, as close to nirvana as I'm ever getting. (In case you couldn't tell by the ingredients, I was a little indecisive about what kind of sandwich I wanted, so I just took the works.)

During lunch it can get a little hairy in Gandolfo's deli, and I'm not talking about the number of people there (which is many) but the ratio of males to females (which is very high, me being the only customer lacking a y chromosome). There is a reason why this is so. These sandwiches are monstrous meat and cheese concoctions slathered in sauce and served big. I could easily make a phallic reference about all these men consuming massive hoagies, but I'm going to take the high road this review.

I was considering the hard salami smothered in sauce, but I didn't know if it would be filling enough...

Okay. So the low road suits me better. 

I opted for the $2.49 meal deal to complement my Dagwood, which left me with a gigantic sandwich, a quarter pound of potato salad, and a regular iced tea with plenty left over for dinner that night. It was close to ten bucks after tax, which is a little bit on the pricey side, but at least I made two meals of it. 

The potato salad was decent but lacked salt, like they didn't bother boiling the potatoes with this necessary ingredient. I love me some salt. Get me a lick and I'll take a cheese grater to it to season my meals. Or make me a salt flavored ring pop for those mid day cravings. My blood pressure will curse you, but I'll be singing your praises. After adding this magic ingredient Gandolfo's potato salad got pretty good, and they get extra credit for using red potatoes, leaving the skin on, and preparing it with vinaigrette and mayo instead of mustard. Yum!

It's pretty decent for a sandwich shop and the menu is intimidating in size and offerings. You could do much worse *coughBlimpie'scough*, so give it a whirl if you find yourself in the area.
Don't ask for pink at Fancy Fur n Purr or you end up with "sweat stained armpit" as the hue 20 minutes later. (Go look at the pictures.) "It washes out with water," they said. It rubs out with 20 minutes of sedentary dog loafing. 

Base cut $60. 
Mohawk down back $15. 
Sweaty armpit stain color $25. 

Also, the pigment is oil based and not a dry powder like chalk, so it goes on wet, dries oily, and leaves behind a yellowish residue. Really awful look all around. 

Would have much preferred some guidance from the staff more along the lines of, "You know you're paying for a dollar per minute of color, right? And that the color leaves an oily residue that will completely negate taking your dog in to be professionally groomed? And that it goes on wet then dries so any texture in your dog's fur will seize up? And that the color doesn't fade, but instead completely disappears leaving behind a yellowish stain?" Honesty rarely makes a buck though.
Does anyone remember when Mill Avenue used to be a fun place to hang out? Yeah, neither do I, but I've been told from the horse's mouth (sorry to call you a horse, Mr. Man) that it used to be a hip and happening place with plenty of small, custom shops and dives instead of the now ubiquitous mega-corporate whorebaggery. Luckily, you have only to travel a little bit further west on University to steep yourself in that old school neighborhood feel. 

Thai Basil gets big stars for being one of these homey neighborhood joints. Along with El Pollo, Tops, Tempe Bicycle, HTC, Otto's, Headquarters, Buffalo, etc., this locally owned restaurant has consistently provided inviting ambiance, wonderful service and delicious food for pennies compared to anything on Mill.

I just finished my leftover red curry chicken just before I wrote this, and it was every bit as savory and rich as it was last night (just make sure to put the leftover sticky rice in a plastic bag or it'll get crusty). The fragrance and flavor of all their curries (red, green, yellow, and peanut) is if not unmatched, pretty damn close to the best offered at any Thai place I've dined. Thick, al dente, crinkle cut carrots, bamboo shoots, green beans, broccoli, zucchini, red and green peppers with tender choice of meat afloat in savory coconut milk that suspends the perfect amount of earthy spice and hot chili to ensure that the meal dances on your taste buds.

My favorite dishes aside, just about everything on the menu at Thai Basil has proved to be exemplary. The Thai Basil is their signature dish and certainly doesn't skimp on its namesake fresh basil and thick flavorful sauce. The Pad Thai is sure as hell better than what's offered at Bamboo Club, with ample crushed peanuts and noodles that don't turn into a puddle of goo once the dish cools. The Garlic Pork has a lighter sauce that still manages all the fragrance and flavor of its more syrupy counterparts. The papaya salad is crisp, citric, sweet and spicy, an excellent accompaniment to a rich meal. Or try the crispy spring rolls that manage to be filling despite their humble size. The chicken satay with peanut sauce is also a very good choice for picky eaters (or kiddos), although they'll truly miss out on the more complex flavors of this amazing food. 

Thai Basil is a fairly small restaurant with dark wood tables that are all very closely spaced to ensure the maximum number of people can be seated. There is booth seating along the back and stretching the length of one side, while high tables and chairs are located in the windowed area facing Farmer. The decorations are sparse but complement the overall Asian feel, with bamboo accessories, knick knacks and family pictures decorating the walls. The richly colored, metallic embroidered skirt\/pants worn by the waitresses are also for sale if you're looking for something special to spice up your wardrobe.

Despite its small size, I've never experienced the long wait times that others have when I come here. The servers have always been very attentive and quick to refill a glass or take my order, and are honest with their opinion when asked what they enjoy on the menu. I don't generally go here on busy nights though, and the hours I attend are either early or late evening, so maybe I avoid the hectic rush, because the kitchen is pretty small. At least you know you're getting fresh Thai from the folks who know it best as a result. If you don't have a lot of time to wait and just want a quick dinner, it's also possible to phone in your order or walk in, order, visit the shops around the restaurant and return in ten minutes to a piping hot order.

Try out the lunch specials! They're a great deal and they get you in and out within the hour. Although this is the one time of the day I've been when it's a bit on the slow side, since the entire restaurant is always packed. But the crowd is oddly well staggered since I've never seen anyone waiting for a table. For about eight bucks you get a small salad with tangy sweet vinaigrette, a spring roll with sweet and sour sauce, and your choice of dish with a ball of rice on the side. It's usually enough so I have one extra lunch leftover, compared to the two lunches I usually have with the regular dinner dishes. 

One thing I've noticed over time is that their "hot" really isn't that hot, so if you like it spicy, make sure to specify. 

Thai Basil is a comfortable neighborhood restaurant that attracts the type of customers Mill Avenue only wishes it could, loyal ones. As Mill whores itself out to the highest corporate bidder, I envision the property owners diving through coins like Scrooge McDuck and doing their best impression of Mr. Burns'. But the obscene retail rent checks signed reflects the boost in product price and the blandness of corporate hegemony. It's a relief for this starving-but-no-longer-student to support a local eatery by driving just a little west of that circus.
This place is straight up creepy and run down. Last time I went all the G&D insignia was gone and the menu seriously said, "Restaurant name to be determined" or something equally as ludicrous. Avoid at all costs. The menu is sub-par, the service is crappy, and the decor is about two decades out of date.
Holy effin' eff! Best happy hour anywhere in the valley! 

Challenge: If you can find a better happy hour than the three dollar bonanza at Cafe Zuzu, I will eat one of the wretched pickled eggs from Palo Verde Lounge, the gray-green eggs that time forgot.

I'll start with the tapas-style appetizers because they really blew me away. Two fall-of-the-bone tender braised pork shanks that will melt in your mouth and fill your belly? Three bucks. A surprisingly ample mini prime rib dip with (unassuming) horseradish mayo and au jus? Three bucks. Two buttery, rich grilled brie and thin sliced green apple sandwiches with fig jam reduction? Three bucks. I'm salivating right now. 

The other two options included the border chili, which had fresh chunks of meat but was a bit bland compared to the rest of the apps, and the bruschetta that was utterly forgettable. Standard tomatoes, olives and capers, nowhere near as memorable as Il Postino or La Bocca's stellar examples. 

Since these apps are a bit on the small side, the best bang for your buck to sate your hunger would be the mini pork shanks, followed closely by the prime rib dip. The artisan grilled cheese was my personal favorite (sooo perfectly buttery, sweet and savory!), but it really would have benefited from another little grilled brie sammich on the plate because they're quite small. 

Several of our party tried the wine (chard, pinot, merlot, and I think they've even got some bubbly) and had positive things to say. While we all had zero interest in trying the beer, since it was just PBR on draft or domestic swill in bottles. There were much better options to be had for three bucks, like the specialty cocktails! 

The waitress that took care of us was kind enough to explain what each of the cocktails entailed. Best liquor bang for your buck? The Hot 'N' Dirty, an extra dirty vodka martini with a splash of Tabasco and three olives. They even bring it out in a little cocktail shaker to pour tableside, ensuring that not a drop of goodness is wasted on the way to your table. Second most potent potable was the Bourbon Smash, a whiskey cocktail that's the illegitimate love child of a mojito and a mint julep. In the words of Sammy J, "It'll getcha drunk!" 

The Gin Fizz was one of the most refreshing cocktails, kind of a gin and tonic with more prominent citrus notes and a splash of simple syrup. And for the girlie girls in attendance, the Bramble, Basil Showbiz and Cherry Limeade will treat ya right! The Bramble was heavy on the blackberry, the Basil Showbiz strawberried out and the Cherry Limeade had me second guessing whether someone had spiked a Sonic limeade. Superb, one and all. I haven't a single bad word to say about any the cocktails taste-wise, although the more frou frou drinks seemed a bit light on the pour. 

Three dollar beer, wine, specialty cocktails and appetizers? A frenzy of (relatively sophisticated) gluttony? A mere 15 bucks. Cafe Zuzu is my new go-to for happy hour!
The word that most aptly describes the Sneaker's experience:

Eww.

This exclamation should be accompanied by a scrunched up nose, sneer or depressed sigh depending on the intonation.

Does the smell of open sewage wafting from the bathrooms entice your tastebuds? Eww! *scrunchy nose*

Do shriveled potato skins, overcooked fried zucchini sticks, or soggy hot wings float your boat? Eww. *disdainful sneer*

Does the fact that they constantly change their specials and scheduled events without notice, luring you into this depressing hole under false pretenses sound dandy? Eww... *depressed sigh*

I live dangerously close to this place, so more often than not I'll end up here when there's a dispute along the veins of: "Whatta you wanna do tonight? I dunno. How bout you?"

Most frequently this is the end decision on a Friday night, when they hold live trivia with a host and the opportunity to win 20 to 30 bucks if you come in first or second place. But it's difficult to enjoy some live trivia when it's canceled every other week without any prior notice. That kind of business ethic doesn't instill any loyalty in your customer base. It's also kind of trashy how our winning credits are always hand written in near illegible chicken scratch on a piece of register tape, only redeemable for food, and only on a day other than trivia time. I get it. You want to lure us back on a weekday so we'll spend money in the bar. Klassy.

I wouldn't have such a problem with the place if it the food was at least worth it. The nachos are huge and covered in lots of toppings but it's primarily cheap-o nacho cheese sauce or sour cream, which add little flavor and just make the whole thing a sloppy mess. The wings are soggy and generic (the hot isn't spicy in the least-- maybe they were referring to the temperature?), and there's an absolutely terrible Island Jerk flavor. The zucchini sticks are always overcooked and soggy. The cheese sticks are hard and chewy, not stringy mozzarella. The potato skins look like shriveled little potato abortions adorned by three bacon bits and some nacho sauce. The pizza is pretty decent and probably your best bet. I wouldn't recommend anything else on the menu. They use cheap, bargain basement product and it shows in the quality of the food.

That leaves the bar to make up for the abysmal food. Too bad that's pretty hit or miss, with an emphasis on the miss. For about a two month stretch Sneakers seemed to change their daily specials week by week if not day by day. One day it would be two dollar ladies mixed drinks all day, next week just 9pm to close. Then it would be two dollar drafts all day, changed to half priced wings during happy hour. I don't like the bait and switch. I understand that a new or struggling place needs to cut costs and redefine its specials but when it's changing that often (too quickly for even the signage on the tables or menus to keep up) there's a serious issue with management that needs to be addressed. 

It seems like they've finally settled things to 75 cent domestic draft beers during happy hour (Coors and Bud) and half priced appetizers. Solid. Then from 9pm to close the daily drink specials start. Good. Keep it simple, stupid.

The service at least tries to make up for the crappy food and ever changing drink specials. They're always more than patient when it comes to explaining the changes and always apologetic when they get the brunt of our disappointment when we've been victims of the ole bait and switch. 

The decor looks like a tacky college sports fan decorated it with all the tables sporting different teams and mascots, and paraphernalia splashed all over the walls willy nilly. There's also a weird identity problem going on, with some cheap wine prints on display in the bar and a gigantic statue of Uncle Lester from the Addams Family dressed in a referee suit. They offer Rock Band but I've never seen anyone playing it. They offer the Buzztime Trivia but hardly any televisions are ever tuned to it. There's a couple pool tables, darts, a basketball game, Buck Hunter and a couple other video games in the back. It just seems to be having an extreme identity crisis, trying to be something different to everyone, but half assing it so no one ends up satisfied.

They've taken to serving beer in plastic cups and giving out paper plates for food during happy hour which is a bit on the depressing side. The general vibe makes it seem like it's on the brink of closing any given week, which is too bad because they easily have one of the best patios in Tempe. 

If you're going to go, sit on the patio and enjoy the greenery, cool water, friendly ducks and turtles sunning themselves. It will make you forget just how much of a downer it is inside the place.
I would never have known of this establishment's existence if it wasn't for the small dining area out front with umbrellas and strange wrought-iron flutterby and dragonfly shaped chairs and tables. Not very comfortable to dine in, but cutesy nonetheless. It also helps that I now work in the surrounding area, since Munch-a-Lunch seems to cater exclusively to the business parks around it. Although it's nothing to write home about, it does a pretty fine job of sating my hunger.

This small hole-in-the-wall joint caters to those on the go with a five dollar sandwich box that consists of a sammich, bag o' chips, candy bar and canned soda. It's a screaming deal compared to most fast food meal deal prices, and you can be in and out in a few minutes. However, if you're willing to wait around a bit (and maybe try out those funky butterfly chairs or watch an old black and white movie on the tele inside), the made to order specials and salads are usually pretty solid and a good bang for your lunch buck. 

One gripe I have with this place is that the consistency is wildly variable depending on the day. I've ordered the Greek salad numerous times (what can I say, I'm a sucker for beets in a salad) and it's been nigh inedible at times due to a heavy hand with the salty dressing and feta cheese. So order dressing on the side if you're a featherweight like me. At times some items have been a bit stale as well. I've had some unfortunate puff pastry that seemed like it had been freezer burned or microwaved a hair too long. And they have a strange propensity for smothering things in sour cream sauce. 

These are little issues in the overall quality of the food though. Sandwiches and salads are always a solid bet, and the Greek menu items have rarely let me down! 

Give it a shot if you're in the area. There's worse things you could do to yourself for five bucks.
Three party dresses for 40 bucks? I'm the belle of the ball, bitches!

Let me reign in my enthusiasm a bit. I don't generally like Ross. It's trashy, unorganized and sticky. Especially the one in Arizona Mills Mall. (I shudder remembering trying to redeem my gift card there last Christmas. Long lines, cheap whorebag\/old granny clothes galore, and it was infested with children.) Typically the majority of clothes at Ross look like they could also be found hanging in my local Goodwill, but I still frequent these crappy stores in hopes of finding a killer deal. (What can I say? I'm a masochist. They keep burning me over, and over and I just line up for the punishment.)

But this shiny new location in Tempe Marketplace and I are undergoing a golden honeymoon period!

It just opened so all the fixtures are new and not covered in human grime yet. The clothes here are surprisingly well organized for this type of scavenger hunt shopping experience. I found my sizes exactly where they should be, a first for any Ross-venture. The clothes here are of the same cheap, thin poly-cotton blends that allows them to keep their prices so low, but they've always lasted a fair amount of time and for the price simply can't be beat. The fashions thankfully aren't still stuck in the late 90s era of baby doll tees, and I managed to find pretty dresses for a wedding, Zombie Prom and for when I want to feel like a tulle entwined princess, all for only 40 bucks! Ross is also pretty good for decorating a bathroom, kitchen or living room on the cheap. And the accessories section at this location rocks. Tons of purses, shoes and jewlery.

So if you're looking for cheap clothes and house accessories that haven't already been pawed at by the masses, go here. Quick! Before it starts to reek of feet and small children.
I enjoy the juicy, succulent taste of murder, but I've also got friends that would skin me if I took them to a steak house. To avoid compromising the values of my veggie friends by forcing them to make me man meat, it's always best to choose a place with plenty of greens on the menu. Pita Jungle is the perfect harmony between flesh renders and herbivores. And it doesn't just have the "hold the chicken" type vegg friendly option on the menu, it's got lentils and shit.

Now, since we've already established that I live under rocks, you can just go ahead and assume I've never been to Pita Jungle. What can I say, the grub hunting was good. But after my first visit you can bet your skinny little vegan ass I'll be noshing right next to you on a regular basis. 

The restaurant has apparently expanded twice since it's been open and it was still hoppin' last night, with an open, airy feel and interesting artwork decorating the walls. We hovered over the seating section booth thingy and were told to go ahead and steal any open seat we liked. Some may find this annoying and unorganized, but I really like it when they let me do that part of their job for them, so we snagged a table for two right next to the window so I could watch some dog TV, which was showing a tig old biddy sorority girl special based on the number of perky young freshman coming and going in the parking lot. (Side note: Big old windows are like big screen dog TVs because dogs don't watch human TV, they keep track of the cats trotting through their territory and bark at the mailman and monitor the comings and goings of the neighborhood through windows. At least in my experience. I'll be sitting there glued to the tube and the dogs will be sitting there glued to the window. End tangent. Thanks for your patience.)

Others have complained about the poor service at this location, but surprise (sarcasm) Mr. Man ends up knowing the waiter assigned to our section, so we were promptly rewarded with menus and drinks. Not that I would have even noticed the wait since I was agape, trying to take in everything offered on a menu that just wouldn't quit. Eventually I grabbed hold of my indecision and narrowed it down to three options, the black bean burger, the lavosh shawarma wrap, or the Caribbean salad. We agreed that not having hummus simply wasn't an option so I went with the shawarma so I could pep it up with some left over hummus, and I really dig lavosh because it reminds me of saltines, which I don't really like that much, but are scrumptious in flatbread form. Mr. Man decided upon the grilled vegetable salad, because if you've ever met him, he really needs to watch his boyish figure (again, sarcasm).

We ordered an extra pita for the hummus, which was overkill and we didn't even end up touching it because the "small hummus" ended up being freakin' huge and the pita was sized to match. It was smooth and creamy, and garnished with two of my favorite vegetables (or whatever an olive technically is), cucumbers and kalamata olives! My one gripe about the entire meal was that my chicken was overly dry and a smidgen bland, but the hummus more than made up for that lack in flavor. The side Greek salad that came with my wrap was also stupendous, with a hefty amount of feta and a delicious, light vinaigrette to counter that richness. Mr. Man's grilled vegetable salad was also very well done, with crisp veggies, lots of garlic and an awesome dressing. 

And this delish bounty of fresh, healthy food came to 20 bucks between the two of us and left us with enough leftovers for lunch tomorrow. I'll definitely be coming here again, and frequently, so I can get my daily dose of granola crunching hippies, sorority sisters, cooler than thou hipsters and SUV driving yuppies with their childrens all in one place. Unheard of!
You like your meat long, smoked, and spicy? They got that. 

Short and thick  with an au naturel casing? They got that too. 

Thin, floppy and tasting of meatloaf? Hey, whatever gets your rocks off. 

The snausages here are crazy amazing and they have just about any pork related product your little heart can dream up, ground to an appetizing taste and texture with just the right amount of spice. The prices are also more than fair compared to other meat markets around town. 

Word to the wise, Schreiner's is a small mom and pop and they only take cash, check (crazy, right?), or debit cards. No credit will be extended to your broke ass. And if you want to use your debit card you have to gather up at least ten bucks worth of meat in your hot little paws before they'll run the card. Don't worry, it's more than easy to do. 

The people that work here are very knowledgeable and if you tell them what you like and why, they'll recommend all sorts of stuff. They have an intimate knowledge of the meat they sling. So stop on buy, shoot the shit, and they'll slip you some mighty fine sausage.
Thai iced tea with condensed milk and boba. Perfection. I love the flaky soft texture of the snoh ice. I want to make sticky snow angels in a vat of it. Be bold. Get red bean or taro. Avoid the boring strawberry.
My work buddies and I decided to go here on a lark for lunch today since we were craving something outside of the traditional Americana fare, and it was everything I thought it would be (but not more, hence the average number of stars). There were no belly dancers or tarot card readers, both dinner time lures advertised upon entering, since the noon-to-one crowd is generally geared toward the white collar crowd. That eliminated the possibility of a razzle dazzle performance that may have lured another star out of me, leaving the service, ambiance and food to shine on their own.

The service was adequate. Not really much to say either way on that. I did kind of like the fact that the wait staff was all eating there in a family setting and were just finishing up when I arrived. That immediately raised my expectations, since they wouldn't settle for anything nasty. Also, the kitchen was filled with....Turks! Not a single word of Spanish, which is quite an anomaly in the food service business. Again, my expectations raised.

Upon entering, the customer is given the option of sitting at regular or low seating. I highly recommend the latter, as it consists of plush pillows and short stools arranged around round tables. The main dining area is very open air with warm colors and sparse decorations, but it feels more sterile than the environment created in the adjacent rooms. Within these rooms comfortable open booths and pillows, upholstered in dark, rich colors are accented by decorative lighting that could have been bought from a bazaar and transported straight here. The layout of these side rooms adds to the ambiance and present plenty of opportunity for conversation. 

We all ordered lunch specials, which are composed of rice, pita bread, cabbage slaw and a meat of some sort. The lamb that I ordered was a little on the bland side and stringy. It would have done much better stewed than grilled. I would also highly recommend you trade the plain ole white rice for the biriani rice, which is saffron (turmeric?) based with veggie bits and walnuts. It was savory and scrumptious, the exact opposite of the cabbage slaw, which was an odd combination of vinegar, mint and garlic. It was a little pricey for a lunch special, ringing in at $10.95 without beverages, and the dinner specials are even more expensive.

I would come here a second time for the atmosphere, and maybe for the belly dancing, but I would definitely try something else off the menu.
Disclaimer: This restaurant is located in Sun City. It is unlikely any of you will find yourself here in the near future and hopefully not even in the far future, as this is where vitality goes to die. But if you find yourself with a flat tire out in the middle of BFE or need to take Grandma out for a night on the town (bedtime by 8pm at the latest, sonny!), this is a pretty respectable choice. And in full confidentiality, it managed to surprise me.
-----------------------------------------------------------

I can't fathom why, but my family resides in the suburban sprawl of Peoria, which happens to border Sun City. I haven't been out to this haven for golf carts and cataracts since I used to live way out in northwest Glendale, but for my stepmother's birthday she wanted to eat at Little Bite of Italy. So we pile in to the car for the mini road trip out there from Tempe.

Having arrived early, Mr. Man and I saunter up to the bar and (gasp!) get carded. Seeing how we were mere babes in the womb compared to some of the patrons there, this was no big surprise. What was surprising was the house sauvignon blanc I ordered that tasted like sweet tarts. And cost a whopping $6.50 for a bitsy little glass. Whatevs. Old people's livers don't work as well as mine, so I can see how they can get away with upping the price.

I was also surprised at this freaky gigantic beer tap that was ordered for the table. It seemed like a little bit of frat boy flava delivered to a demographic that could be their parents or grandparents. It was a wicked cool cylindrical device that held three pitchers and had a chilled center at the base. A gigantic bong of of booze if you will.

Since I'm indecisive I went with the sampler: meat lasagna, chicken parmesan and fettuccine alfredo. Aside from the fact that it needed salt (again, my blood pressure probably isn't as high as the older folks), the meal was pretty tasty. The alfredo was lackluster, but I've rarely had good alfredo from a restaurant so it was no surprise. I also grazed on a piece of The Works pizza with sausage, pepperoni, onions, mushroom, red and green peppers. That was far superior and the left over pizza reheated to a lovely crisp in the oven the next day.

The entertainment was probably the highlight of the evening. There was a 50+ (don't want to offend by guessing wrong), petite female performer in what could have doubled as a figure skating outfit singing her little heart out on stage. She had a great voice, oozed mature sex appeal all over the male customers (no need for viagra that night) and took requests like the pro she was. All ages were shakin' what their momma gave them up in front of the stage, me included, and it was a surprising amount of fun.

I never knew Sun City could be so spry! Respect.
If you're looking for a dive bar without the skeeze layered on thick, consider this gem. 

I know, why call it a dive if there aren't painted-up hussies propped on bar stools and you're not afraid to contract something lasting from touching the bathroom features? Because it's more like that neglected house down the street owned by the Cat Lady that has chipped paint and an overgrown yard, but when you stop there on Halloween she always has those awesome popcorn balls. Or that ottoman that's a little frayed around the edges and is patched with duct tape to keep the upholstery skirt on, but it's the comfiest damn foot rest. 

Despite the looks, the bar is a local watering hole that attracts your quirky neighbors. Someone brought in the pelt of a javelina they'd shot the day prior to show it off to his buddies. Ever seen one of those ugly things up close? You just might get the chance if you decide to check it out. Chuy's two doors down will serve as a neon-lit mecca for mass consumption, while Baseline Pub will remain the watering hole in the wall that's a little more mellow and a little rougher around the edges.

Happy hour is twelve hours long, from ten to ten, so they don't really have any drink specials, but the prices are cheap so that's not really an issue. Plus there's the requisite pool tables that every good dive has, so you've got something to occupy your time in addition to conversation with the locals.

The down side is that the mixed drinks are a bit on the weak side, so stick with beer. The music selection kind of sucks at times, with either country western or classic rock playing. (Cross your fingers for the classic rock.) The waitresses are pretty inattentive as well, so make sure there aren't any lapses in conversation, because silence sure drags long without something to quench your thirst.
Ode to Top's Liquor

To look upon your well stocked shelves I smile,
You let me mix n' match my heart's desire.
Though sober now check back after awhile,
As bombers, pints and fifths sure spark a fire.
This social lube you offer is smooth n' cheap,
From Champagne, Brewski, Liquor to Wine.
Clever, friendly staff if asked for help will leap,
And serve impending hangovers of mine.
They also stock cigarettes and drunk treats,
True boozehounds know selection can't be beat!

Amateur poetry hour has now ended. To be returned to your regularly scheduled Yelp reviews, just scroll down.
Every time I go waltzing around The District (ahem, twice) I make sure to stop by this hidden gem for some extreme iced tea action. I use extreme in the sense that there's 100s of options that all end in AWESOME. White peach iced AWESOME, iced pomegran-AWESOME, four AWESOME berry tea, creme brulAWESOME. And those are just the flavors I've sampled. I could be "The Richmeister" from SNL while lavishing praises upon these teas.

Going with the white peach-a-rino, iced pomegrana-rama-ding-dong, the creme brulee-ster, four berries? Berry nice. Makin' the copies...

But I digress.

Tea Infusion has an awesome location in terms of drawing in business, so all you naysayers that are poo pooing its place nestled among chain stores can just shut it. From a business perspective it makes perfect sense. People get thirsty when shopping, especially in the desert, and this place appears like an oasis on the horizon. If it was a dinky little independent establishment it would never receive the exposure that it does at Tempe Marketplace and probably would have a hard time staying solvent, regardless of how much we adoring Yelpers build it up. So I'd rather laud the smarts of a business man who broke through the corporate mold and managed to offer an independent and hip lil tea shop amid the brand name wasteland that is Tempe Marketplace than complain about it. 

It's so nice to step into this place, breath a sigh of relief and shake off the oppressive crowd of consumers (and anklebiters) waiting just outside that door, especially if it's a weekend evening. And I've got to say that a nice cuppa makes the window shopping, caterwauling live band, and gaggles of giggling adolescents much more enjoyable.

Aside from a tea selection that puts China Mist to shame, they offer some munchitos that I've never indulged in like sandwiches, sides and scrumptious looking desserts. One day, Tea Infusion, one day.

The only complaint I have is with the staff. 

I understand you don't make much and sometimes customers are devilish. I've been a barista before. But that's no excuse to neglect your customers or the cleanliness of your establishment. I went on a Saturday night and one chick was very loudly and obnoxiously chatting up a customer, leaving her coworker to fall behind when handling group after group of people by his lonesome. The counter was filthy and cluttered with tea paraphernalia, smoothie stuff, dirty steeping devices, and milk that someone had neglected to put back in the refrigerator. I wanted to jump behind the counter, tidy up that terrible mess and help a dude out, then give that flirty flit at the end of the counter a piece of my mind. 

I get the disenfranchisement you feel when being paid slightly over minimum wage, but have a little respect for customer service and the integrity of your shop or you won't have one to report to for long.
The next time I want microwaved hot wings and pizza crust that tastes like a water and flour slurry made love to a bland piece of cardboard, I'll be sure to hit up Otto's. I had to seriously blast those hot wings in the broiler to make them even remotely crispy and even then they were still rubbery. The pizza was so overwhelmingly mediocre we tossed the rest after dinner instead of refrigerating it. 

Also, calling in an order and then showing up 20 minutes later to be greeted with, "Oh, we didn't start your order because we couldn't call the number you gave us back," when they clearly had caller ID and the number was misheard one off, was new to me. So was sitting there for an additional 20 minutes and watching them microwave a plate of hot wings. Never seen that before either. I don't know how you're still in business, Otto's. Not even collegiate nostalgia will get me to stop there again.
I think I just don't like El Salvadoran food. It's either that or I accidentally consumed the cardboard and polymer display models in lieu of my actual entree. That was some seriously dry, bland food. Even tossing some watered down hot sauce on that pile of bland meat and carbs didn't really improve the edibility. I had the appetizer platter and the chicken with white rice and weird white sauce with a dry side salad. It was a bland, white platter of food. Plus, what's with the side salad of iceberg and radishes? Is it garnish? It's not dressed with anything and, you know, tastes just like a pile of lettuce. 

Maybe I'm just an ignorant prick. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. Maybe I just don't like El Salvadoran (although I love just about everything else Central American). 

The pupusas were crazy delicious though. I would totally return for these. (And only these.)
Best place for pho I have found in the valley. Get the #1 with everything: tripe, tendon, fatty flank, meatballs and the regular beef. Don't let the ingredients intimidate you. It's out of this world good!

If pho is in your future, be forewarned that the serving sizes are massive. I have never been able to polish off an entire bowl. So come extra hungry and skip the tempting spring rolls (also delicious with a killer spicy peanut sauce). Because if you've ever made the mistake of trying to stretch out a bowl of pho by taking half of it home, you know the disappointment that comes along with that cloudy bowl of watered down leftovers. Rice noodles just don't hold up well. Le sigh.

Lately I've taken to phoning in my order and picking up my Pho To Go (someone needs to snatch up that name, stat!) at the same price as the dine in option ($6-8). I have discovered the secret to pho longevity this way. Noodles and beefy parts are packaged separately and the broth is also in its own container. Nothing gets water logged and cloudy and I can easily make four meals out of one order. They toss in all the baggies of goodness too! Bean sprouts, basil, limes, jalapeno and mint in one; cilantro and spring onions in another. Hoisin and sriracha on the side. I seriously get hog wild with these additions. It's like a new bowl every time I try it!
The Bamboo Club has got me all mixed up. Can ambiance and service compensate for sub par food at ridiculous prices? Oh, the dilemma! I like the beautiful decor and attentive service, but I also like reasonably priced entrees with discernable flavor. Let's see...nope. Well that didn't take very long to decide.

I've eaten at this location several times. The last time was with a very large group of people, and I got to try many different things off the menu. It basically boiled down to two flavor categories: spicy or non-spicy. The spicy dishes tasted like they had been prepared in one stock sauce. The non-spicy dishes tasted like they had been prepared in a similar sauce that omitted the chili oil. Here and there they added other things, like black bean paste or some sweetness, but most of the dishes tasted pretty much the same. I suppose this is why the menu doesn't go into detail when describing the difference between entrees, just listing "Mongolian Chicken" or "BC Hot and Spicy Chicken," since just the veggies and protein are interchangeable and no really strong flavor characterizes any one dish. 

We started off with the appetizer sampler: Sesame Honey Chicken, BC Egg Rolls, Coconut Shrimp, and Pot Stickers. Everything was perfectly adequate and worth the price since it served 4 people. The chicken was crispy, sweet and sprinkled with sesame seeds. The egg rolls tasted like they had been fried in old oil, but I fixed that by dousing it in hot mustard. The coconut shrimp were thin, crunchy, and not too sweet. The pot stickers were steamed with a delicious pork filling, probably the best thing on the tray. It was all pretty good filler before the meal. But it's kind of a sad affair when the appetizers trump the actual main course...

Everything came out really fast for a group of nine people and was piping hot. We shared it family style and here's the details, from best entree to worst:
*Cantonese Noodles- Wicked fricken good! If I end up going again, I'm definitely ordering this dish. Shrimp, scallops, BBQ pork, chicken and Asian vegetables with wheat noodles tossed in a light but flavorful sauce.
*Grilled Halibut- Well cooked and flaky. Mango and pineapple salsa was decent and the presentation was very well done.
*Chicken with Asparagus- I was barely able to distinguish the black bean sauce it was supposedly cooked in, but the chicken was tender and the asparagus al dente. 
*BC Spicy Chicken- This falls under the 'spicy' category of food flavoring. It was a little spicy, a little sweet, and very generic. Supposedly their equivalent of 'Kung Pao,' but it tasted...weirder than any other Kung Pao I've had. 
*Mandarin Orange Scallops- Tough and overcooked, same flavors as the BC Spicy Chicken but with more sugar and no kick. The crispy spinach was interesting though.
*Bamboo Bejing Duck- It was overcooked and dry rather than being crispy. The Asian pancakes were also dry, but the accompanying plum sauce lubricated things well enough. 
*Pad Thai Rice Noodles- Turned into a sticky noodle block after the first couple minutes. I've made the equivalent from a box in the 'Asian foods' aisle at Fry's. 
*Thai Curry Chicken and Shrimp- The Bamboo Club needs to focus on their Chinese offerings instead of their piss poor Thai dishes. Not good by any stretch of the imagination.

The side dishes were, like the appetizers, respectable but not amazing. The Dynasty Fried Rice tasted a lot like any other fried rice you'd order. No surprise or disappointment there. The Woked Mushrooms were very well cooked in a light sauce. Much better than most of the entrees even though it was a side dish. The Woked Asparagus had the same flavor as the mushrooms, both of which tasted suspiciously similar to the Chicken with Asparagus. Perhaps it just lacked the dollop of black bean paste?

So if you go, go for the ambiance. The patio is nice for Mill Avenue people watching and secluded enough to enjoy your meal with a little privacy. The service is attentive and quick to refill any glass or comply with your requests, even for a large group of people. At the very least these guys deserve the high tips generated by pricy entrees. It's too bad the food is so damn generic. Definitely not worth the 13-25 dollar price tag per entree. 

Maybe happy hour is the best option for attending this place? Cheap three dollar appetizers and drink specials without the unnecessary disappointment of crappy food? Maybe I'll give it a whirl in the future.

If you're wrangled into dinner there, go with the Cantonese noodles, crispy spinach and woked veggies. Best stuff on the menu. Or risk it and order something else. Maybe I went on an off night...but I doubt it since this is a corporate chain the same the country over.
There are several shared characteristics of a good dive bar:
1. Cash only for cheap, stiff drinks.
2. Pool tables (or alternately, shuffle board. darts must be combined with some other lure in order to count.)
3. Jukebox (classic rock required, the top 40 laughed out of the place.)
4. An air of disrepair (rips in the booth upholstery, musty smell of smoke on the air- because despite the ban, it's already been cured into the wood.)

This place has all those things in spades.

I hardly ever end up at the Time Out Lounge because I never carry cash, but the drinks are deliciously strong and don't strip your wallet of its greenery too quick. There's an ATM there too. The pitchers and half pitchers are also pretty cheap, but if you're drinking by yourself, you're required to get the half pitcher. Apparently they can't serve you a drink the size of your head in one sitting. What wacky laws.

There are several pool tables that take up the majority of the space, but if you're going during the rush, good luck securing one of them. I'm not that great at pool, but I really enjoy playing at this place (usually with a good partner I can coast off of and then gloat with after we win) because of the atmosphere. So don't be a hater. 

There's a dart board off to the side of the place in a raised area with a couch and a jukebox. My friend and I got our asses handed to us on a plate by a couple of British expatriates in a game of cricket. But tall dark and handsome can beat me any day. It's all about the accent. Surprisingly, I've never used the jukebox. But I have heard wonderful tales of it from multiple people.
