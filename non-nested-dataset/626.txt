The quality of the food is great, they are specialized in <goat cheese/>. It is a convenient place for a romantic supper or a diner at lunch break! I would totally recommend this place, if you are a <cheese/> addict, this is the place to be. Watch out on weeknights for opening hours, Thursday and Friday it is opened later.
