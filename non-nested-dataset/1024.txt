I'm definitely not a fast food person, especially being a vegetarian, but I was super hungry after playing a show here at the Excalibur one night and went with my band members.  Lo and behold, they have a <veggie burger/>!  So, I ordered that and <tater tots/>.  Enjoyed everything I got!  It's a fun, old-fashioned vibe.  The dance routine that the staff has to do was ehhh.  I could tell they weren't into it.  I would probably feel silly doing it, too.  But, still a good experience.  Definitely consider this a food option if I'm in that casino.
