Cute little hole in the wall place. Two entrances, one by a side street by an apartment building and the other side of the entrance in the mall.

They had lunch specials that are applicable on the weekend, so we ordered:
- <chirashi/>
- <<salmon/> teriyaki/>
- <kalbi/>
- <<chicken/> <katsu/>/>
- dynamic \/ <california roll/>

All was very good and very fresh! 

Definitely recommend it and will be coming back!
