This is a most stop for me and my girlfriend whenever I'm back in TO. We always order:

- the <<radish/> <cake/>/> 
- <calamari/> 

both are really good - but it is a bit spicy.

And typically we will order a <congee/> (you really can't go wrong with any of them) and a <noodle/> dish.

What can I say? <Congee/> and <noodles/> is always good.
