Wow!  I loved this place!  I had no idea what to get, since I'd never been there before, but it seems like it's a win no matter what you might choose.  I can't wait to come back here many times to try different combinations.  The staff here are all super nice people, and our waitress checked on us lots of times to make sure we were taken care of and enjoying our <pasta/>.  SO so good.  If you haven't tried this place and you're looking for something different, go for it!
