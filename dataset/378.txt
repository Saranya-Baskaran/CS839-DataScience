From the outside, this doesn't seem like the kind of place that would have a <<veggie/> <burger/>/>, or have amazing service, but they have both!  Their <red <wine/>/> is also delicious.  I wish I would have grabbed the server's name, she was awesome and completely on top of things, making sure my friend and I were taken care of while we were there.  Looking forward to coming back at some point.
