<hand made <noodles/>/>. fast. great service. open kitchen. Need i to say more?

There was a line up when we got there, but it moves pretty fast (approximately 10 mins wait). As soon as the server sees you there waiting, he offers you a glass of water.

Staff is extremely friendly and nice. Service is really fast. Even faster when you speak chinese to them.

My boyfriend and I had ordered the <<soup/> <dumplings/>/>, <sweet and sour <<veggie/> <<pork/> <noodle/>/>/>/> and a <<beef/> <noodle/>/>. The <<soup/> <dumplings/>/> were good, as they are made on the spot. The <<veggie/> <<pork/> <handmade <noodle/>/>/>/> was really good. The <<beef/> <noodle/>/>, not so much.

They are definitely known more for their <handmade <noodles/>/>. 

Will be returning the next time I'm in town to try the spicy <noodle/> and <shanghai <noodle/>/> everyone is raving about!
