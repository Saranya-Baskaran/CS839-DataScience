Love the vibe of this place!  My date and I got to eat on the second level, so we got the bonus of a great view.  There isn't much on the menu that's vegetarian (otherwise it'd be a five-star rating for me), but the <<portabello <mushroom/> <sandwich/>/> and <salad/> I had was delicious!  I can't remember what our appetizer was called, but they were yummy, as well (picture below).  I even sprang for the <<carrot/> <cake/>/> (my date had <cheesecake/>) for dessert - no regrets!  Our server was attentive and courteous, and his recommendation (the appetizer) was spot on.  Great eats!
