Tried to book an appointment to use the voucher my friend had given me. it was for a mani\/pedi\/foot massage. Left a message, but never heard back.

Finally decided to email them, requesting for an appointment. The response I got back was they are under new ownership and is no longer accepting the vouchers.

Such a disappointment!
