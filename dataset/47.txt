OMG - came here with some friends for Brunch and wow!

We did have to wait for about 30 mins for a table for 4 (but it was later in the day). 

Looking at their menu,  we wanted to try everything! the <French <toast/>/>, the <<strawberry/> <shortcakes/>/>..<donuts/> (they were sold out by the time we got there).

but we wind up only ordering two things: 

the classic - 2 <eggs/> any style, house cured <bacon/> or <<sage/> and <<onion/> sausage/>/>, crispy griddled <<<red skin <potatoes/>/> with <sea salt/>/> and <thyme/>/>. Served with <toast/> of your choice. Upgrade your <toast/> to a <buttermilk <biscuit/>/> 

Emma's Benny - Warm and fluffy <buttermilk <biscuit/>/> topped with house cured <peameal <bacon/>/>, poached <eggs/> and smothered in <mousselline <sauce/>/>. Served with a side of griddled <red skin <potatoes/>/>.

big portions - really good!

if you want the benny, make sure you asked them if they still have it as they tend to sell out quick - I had ordered the last one of the day!!!
