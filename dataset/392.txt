This was the first restaurant I went to, upon moving here to Vegas.  Great first impressions!  I'm a vegetarian, so I had the <<tofu/> <burrito/>/>.  I can't remember everything I had on it, but there are so many options.  The place was crammed when we were there - and no wonder.  I love the fusion of <sushi/> and Mexican.  You wouldn't think these two things could go together, but they do, and it's yummy.  Definitely plan on returning here.
