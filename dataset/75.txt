Cute place in Danforth and Coxwell area!

It has a nice patio to sit, which is also dog friendly! 

We had tried the <wild boar <pizza/>/> - which was very good! Definitely want to try the other items on the menu!

Friendly service. Definitely will be back here more often since it is so close to us!
