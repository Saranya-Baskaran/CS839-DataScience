This review is mainly for the pool only.

Love that it has a nice indoor salt water pool for the doggies to use. It is small, and only meant for 1 dog at a time. I have a small little one that makes this size work well for him, but not sure how the bigger dogs can really swim in here.

The pool is great as the water is lukewarm so my little guy is willing to go in (as we have been to another indoor pool which the water is cold).

For the 1st time users, they have an instructor there to help assess what your dog can do or not do, that way you don't scared them off from swimming.

After that, you are free to book time for just you and your pup.

And they have a tub outside of the pool to bath them when they are done.

Overall, no complaints with them!
