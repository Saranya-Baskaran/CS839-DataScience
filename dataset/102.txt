Sometimes it feels SO good to be SO bad...for you. I have been dying to try out an actual <poutinerie/> for a long time and it did not disappoint. I've been twice now. Once I had the basic <poutine/> and once I had the pulled <<pork/> poutine/>. Both are good, but I really love that pulled <<pork/> poutine/>. The BBQ <sauce/> they have has just a touch of sweetness and it really compliments the <fries/> and <<cheese/> curds/>. A large <poutine/> is more than enough for two people and I liked the little restaurant space with the 80s glam rock playing and quirky pictures on the walls. I guess my only criticism is that they need more seating. Both times I've been we got lucky and managed to snag seats as someone was leaving, but it's gross out on the street and this summer anyway, it's been SO hot outside. They don't have space for more seats, so this isn't really something they can easily fix, but maybe something to keep in mind for future establishments? Anyway, if you want a very unhealthy treat, it's a go!
