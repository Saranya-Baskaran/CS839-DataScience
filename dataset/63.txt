Came here after dinner to meet up with some friends...it was nice and roomy for 7 people. 

We ordered a plate of <Rosemary <fries/>/> to share, which wasn't bad, however when served it was room temperature and did not taste like it just came out of the fryer.

BF had ordered a couple of <beers/>, which he was not impressed at all with.
