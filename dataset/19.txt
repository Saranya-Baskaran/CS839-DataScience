Came here for a <burger/> as one of my friends said they had good <burgers/> and people from work would come by twice a month for a <burger/> run.

Ordered the original was was ok, wasn't as amazing as everyone says it to be. I think the veggie option would have been better.

A little pricy for a take-out <burger/>.
