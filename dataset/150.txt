Great little place, one of my favs in the area. Why? Well for starters, the gentleman who owns the establishment is lovely and personable. I think their portions are large and the <fish/> to be yummy and not too bland. I also really like that they make their OWN <tartar <sauce/>/>. So few places seem to do this. You get like 1-2 of those little packets. 

One star off for it being rather small portions.
