Not sure what the hype is, but decided to give this a try based on all the reviews.

Maybe it was too hyped up, but it wasn't as amazing as I thought it would be. Maybe it was what we had ordered, but it was just ok. We had ordered the <<kimchi/> <fries/>/>, which was kind of like a <NY <Fries/>/> "the works". The <grilled <<pork/> <banh mi/>/>/> was ok. 

Will be back to try other stuff, like the <bao/> version and the <<pork/> belly/>.
