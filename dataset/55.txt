Nice place by Cumberland place. After we had sat down, we were given two HUGE blown up <pitas/>. So we had ordered the <<eggplant/> dip/> to go with it. It had a nice smoked flavour to it but not even <garlic/> taste for my liking so it was just a-ok.

Ordered a <<chicken/> <shawarma/>/> and a <<mango/> <<strawberry/> <juice/>/>/>. The <juice/> was yummy and would definitely order it again! The <shawarma/> - I'm not sure about it. The <meat/> wasn't as tasty as I thought it would be. Maybe I need to try the <falafel/> instead next time.
