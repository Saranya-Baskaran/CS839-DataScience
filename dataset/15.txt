This place is awesome! Definitely authentic!!!

My two favourite dishes are the <<rice/> flour rolls/> and the <<chicken/> <pho/>/>. The <<rice/> flour rolls/> are always fresh whenever I'm there! And the <<chicken/> <pho/>/> is always flavourful!! mmmm....just thinking of it makes me want some!

My boyfriend is Vietnamese and he agrees that this place is authentic and one of the best Vietnamese restaurants he has ever eaten at.

Prices are very reasonable too!
