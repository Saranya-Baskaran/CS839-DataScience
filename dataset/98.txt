I started going to this nail salon last summer, so for almost a year now. It had just opened when I started going and I walked in off the street because I figured I'd take a chance, it looked clean and it was close to home. 
I was greeted by the owner, a pleasant Chinese woman, who did my nails that day. Since then, I've been back at least once a month for manicures and pedicures. Those are the only things I've had done, but I would suspect that the other services are pretty good as well. 
The spa is new and everything is spacious and clean. They have massaging chairs for pedicures and the prices are reasonable. 
It's a basic nail place, so the bells and whistles are not numerous, but that suits me fine because it keeps the price down, allows for walk-ins and gets you in and out pretty quickly. 
Some of the ladies in the salon do a better job than others, but no one does a bad job. I have had plenty of bad manicures before, so I know what a bad job looks like. Just don't go expecting someone to fuss over you, or give you plenty of conversation. English is not the first language and I have never felt the need to force conversation. 
In this past year I have noticed a huge increase in the number of people that go to this spa, so they seem to be doing quite well. I have never had to wait more than ten minutes for service though and I'm happier they are busy because it means they are doing well and will stay in business. Good for them AND for me! 
Some of the services they give include manicures, pedicures, gel nails, waxing, threading, eyebrow tinting and ear candles.
