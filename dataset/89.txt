We got a permit to have wedding photos taken here.  
The garden itself was great: 5 stars all around.

The staff was horrible.  The person manning the place claimed there were no bathrooms, complained about where our group was standing (twice!), and then warned us that 'if you aren't out on time I will come in and find you, and I really don't want to do that.'  Its been a long time since I was treated so rudely.  

Go to the garden, avoid the staff.
