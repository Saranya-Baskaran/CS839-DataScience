I ate here with a friend, and I plan to come back again because there are so many items on the menu that I want to try.  I had the <<tomato/> <basil/> <pasta/>/>, and it was so yummy.  The portion size was good, too, I thought (for the price) - not too much and not too little.  I like the outdoor seating option, too (though we did not take advantage of it).  The District is a beautiful place to be, so if you're in the area, stop by!  The food and the scenery are both very worthwhile.
