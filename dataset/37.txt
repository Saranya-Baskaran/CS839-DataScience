Cute shop love the concept!

Lots of varieties of <cookie/> but pretty pricy! There are probably about 10 varieties <cookies/> and about seven <milk/> flavours. The <<banana/> flavoured <milk/>/> reminds us of the <banana/> cough syrup we used to drink as a kid!

They do have homemade <<<cookie/> <<ice/> <cream/>/>/> <sandwiches/>/> but the <cookie/> is on the thinner side.
