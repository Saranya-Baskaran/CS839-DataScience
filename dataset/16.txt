a must stop when you are in montreal!

I was in Mtl for the weekend and wind up eating here 2 nights in a row!

The <sandwiches/> here are unbelieveable! The smoked <meat/> is so tasty and salty but so good. The <bread/> definitely complements the <meat/>!

Not much of a line up if you come either later in the evening.

Remember to leave a tip in the plate when you order take out and the servers will be extra nice and funny!
