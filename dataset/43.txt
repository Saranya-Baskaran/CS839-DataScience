found this bakery while wandering on Queen Street - it was hidden on a side street.

walked inside to check it out and it was very quaint inside. Lots of variety. We had gotten a loaf of <Brioche <bread/>/> - it was so good. Soft and sweet - just the way it should be.

they have lots of other <bread/> that I can't wait to go back and try!
