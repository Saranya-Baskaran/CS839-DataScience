My sister loves this place! Probably comes by once a week, once every two weeks!

The <hot pot/> for two is a great deal! Lots of food that can probably feed 3 (assuming you aren't  huge eaters - just regular eaters).

When it's not <hot pot/> time, my sister says they have really good <Hot Stone <Bibimbap/>/> - which is what she typically gets.
