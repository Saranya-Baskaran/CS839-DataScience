Visiting from SF.  Checked yelp and found this place.  It is very small -- a converted house.  As you sit in it you can watch the kitchen.  The food was excellent.  We had an <<eggplant/>\/<red pepper/> <omelet/>/> and <<peach/> <waffles/>/>.  The <waffles/> were light and fluffy with fresh whipped <creme/>.

We got <pastries/> to go, which were also good, in particular the <<chocolate/> <croissant/>/> was unique.

Great place for an informal breakfast.
