Flavor was actually pretty good. Not used to eating <menudo/> with <tortilla/> but it was pleasant. <Lemonade/> had a very good flavor. Did not have to ask for a refill, it was brought to me. Service was prompt and my food was at my table in no time. It was not really busy either so maybe that helped. Good experience!
