I went here last week with a friend, and it was fantastic.  First of all, I love that they make the <guacamole/> right in front of you.  Very cool!  (And also, it was very delicious!)  I got the vegetarian <fajitas/> (YUM!), and I had enough food for two more meals later - so definitely  value for your money.  The service was also fantastic.  I didn't even have to run out of water before the waiter was at my table giving me more.  I think we had maybe three different waiters attending to different things at our table.  All in all, my friend and I felt very well taken care of!  I recently moved here from the Midwest... never going to eat Mexican back home again.  I'm too spoiled now!  Great experience, and delicious food!
