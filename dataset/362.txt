Good hot <coffee/>, very friendly staff, dog friendly, and they're open early enough for me to stop in before work. Also, the <pastries/> look and smell AMAZING! Haven't had a chance to try them yet, but I'm definitely looking forward to it. We have a lot of coffee shops downtown but this one seems like it will be a winner.
