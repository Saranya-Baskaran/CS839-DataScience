I've stopped in here several times. It's always busy but they seem to move along at a decent speed.

As with all fast food joints nowadays be sure to check your bag before you go as there's a 50\/50 chance they won't get your order right.

They've got one of those new machines inside where you can place your order and <juice/> and <shakes/>. Thanks but no thanks. I'd rather place my order with an old fashioned human being.
