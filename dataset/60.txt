Fish is good, really good. Love how you could have so many different options for fish choices. <Chips/> is only ok. <Onion rings/> are not the same as the regular <onions/>, a little too crispy.

I had ordered the <house <organic batter <mahi mahi/>/>/> - very light, not really heavy. <Creamy <coleslaw/>/> is flavourless. Shared the O.T.H <Poutine/> which was ok but not for me. Will go back to try the <pull <pork/>/> or <<duck/> confit/> one. 

Good for gluten free. =)
