Solid 3.5 rating for this place.  It's hard to rate it anything else, since all I had was a glass of <wine/> (though it was good).  I got carded by the staff, which is a compliment, but nothing extraordinary about <O'Aces/> that would make me come back over and over again, especially since (after poring over the menu) discovering there were no vegetarian options that appealed to me.
