This is place very great flavor. Server was on top of things and everything that we ask for it was brought to us. <Chips/> and <salsa/> given at the beginning of the meal had a great flavor as well. The <bread/> with the <menudo/> was toasted and a spread of <butter/> which gave it a home flavor. I would gladly recommend this place. I was going to give 4 stars instead of  5 stars because the <<Coke/> Zero/> had expired but was gladly replaced with a new one. No questions asked. Great service!
