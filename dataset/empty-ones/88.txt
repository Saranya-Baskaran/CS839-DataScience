THEY SELL WRECKED VEHICLES! 
I purchased a 2010 Nissan Altima with 41,000 miles on it in 2013 from Planet Nissan. They charged me $18,000 and provided me with no warranty, except for manufacturer powertrain. Immediately after purchasing the vehicle I began having to make out of pocket repairs to the suspension, brakes and exhaust system every 6 to 9 months with absolutely no clue as to why after all the repairs the car still drove somewhat unsteady at high speeds. 
    Two years after I bought the car I was finally sick of the constant problems and decided to trade it in with another dealership, during the trade in process I found out that Planet Nissan had sold the vehicle to me knowing that it was involved in a "major" car accident which caused frame damage six months prior to them selling it to me.
Unfortunately there's not much I can do now, but I would advise any savvy consumer to avoid this dealership by all means possible and go someplace that is a bit more reputable!
