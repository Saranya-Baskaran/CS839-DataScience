Horrible customer service!! Warning do not purchase anything from here, don't waste your time!!! Purchased $2,500 worth of furniture told sells person numerous times to deliver furniture in original boxes I didn't want it assembled.  Well received my delivery and everything was assembled!!!!! $700 table was damaged!!!! Living room furniture was stuffed in delivery truck with people's nasty old mattress....completely unprofessional and not worth it!!! Sent my whole order back for refund!! Called customer service talked with a guy named Chris, the absolute worst customer service agent I've ever spoken too.....Was missing the love seat, well guess what it's completely sold out.  Please spare your time and money! Don't waste it here, furniture might be good price but not worth the experience. I must save delivery guys were very nice.
