Went with my friend as we had purchased the Groupon back in April. Before the Groupon, reviews were pretty good for this place. But not sure if it is because of the amount of Groupons they sold, their service and attitude has gone downhill.

We were a little late for our appt, but we had called ahead to notify them (only to get the answering machine). When we got there, the receptionist was rude and said, typically we don't take appts that are this late, as we are booked back to back, but this time we will take you in. And when we looked around the salon, there was only 2 other people getting their nails done.

The two girls that did our nails were really nice. My friend kept smudging her almost dried nails, so they had fixed it for her twice.

At the end of the day, we had to pay the $1.25 HST on top of the tips.

Overall, we would not go back again.
