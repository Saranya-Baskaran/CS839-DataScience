Cycle Pub Las Vegas was a blast! Got a groupon and rented the bike for 11 of us for an afternoon tour. Each bar was more fun than the last. Downtown Las Vegas has changed so much and for the better. We had a wide age range in this group from early 20's to mid 50's and everyone had so much fun! Our driver Tony was knowledgable , friendly and just plain fun! Would recommend this to anyone looking to do something different away from the strip. You won't be disappointed!
