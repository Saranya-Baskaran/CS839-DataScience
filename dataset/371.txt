I've been here twice, and have had great food and a-plus service both times.  I love that they're open 24\/7, too!  It's hard to find good non-fast-food restaurants with those hours, so this place is a go-to in that department, as well.  I can't remember what I had the first time I came here, but most recently I had their <ravioli/> - yum!  Thanks, Bootlegger!
