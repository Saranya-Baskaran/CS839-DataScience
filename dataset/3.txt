Lester's is located in a beautiful neighborhood and has been there since 1951. They are known for smoked <meat/> which most deli's have but their <<brisket/> <sandwich/>/> is what I come to montreal for. They've got about 12 seats outside to go along with the inside. 

The smoked <meat/> is up there in quality and taste with Schwartz's and you'll find less tourists at Lester's as well.
