I don't do <ice <cream/>/>-ish desserts, pretty much ever, but every once in a while, I appreciate good <custard/> \/ fro-yo.  A friend took me here, and both of us very much enjoyed what we had.  (He'd been there before, I hadn't.)  Good custard is good <custard/>; but the walls covered in antique signs, license plates, and other 50s-themed memorabilia is a fun touch that makes it feel old-fashioned and fun.  Whether you're an occasional dessert lover like me, or a passionate one, you're bound to enjoy a visit here.
