I thought Tidy's Flowers had a great reputation as a florist, but I guess I was wrong!

For Valentine's Day my boyfriend had ordered roses with Tidy's. However, the flowers that were delivered was not what he had ordered. He had placed in an order for long stem roses, mixed with orchids and was charged for that. What had showed up was a small vase with 4 short cut roses and some greens - table ornament, not really Valentine's Day flowers. 

In speaking with another friend, something similar happened to her - her fiancee had ordered a dozen of roses for her for Valentine's Day while he was in Germany as a surprise and they never showed up. So when he called them to complaint, they actually then called up my friend to confirm whether or not she had received the flowers. Which she didn't, so they said they would resend - only to have them deliver it to the wrong place.

Understanding that Valentine's Day is the most busiest day for florists and mistakes do happen, the way they had handled it was not what would have been expected from a florist of that nature.
