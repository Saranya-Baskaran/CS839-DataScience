We were here on a holiday Monday where nothing much was open. We had to grab some takeout as we were in a rush and this was the only place open.

We ordered:
- <beef <<noodle/> <soup/>/>/>
- <grilled <pork chop/> <rice/>/>
- <grilled port <vermicelli/>/> 

The food was ok, nothing exciting and kind of bland.
