You can see that people only eat here to use the vouchers they have purchased - as they seem to always have some sort of deal available.

unless you come early enough - make sure you make reservations, otherwise it will take up to 30 mins to get seated (for a table of 2).

The food is ok. Not the greatest I've had, but definitely not the worst. For the price you are paying ($15 for $30 worth of food) - it's ok.

Definitely only visit if you had purchased a voucher.
