Saw that this was in my neighbourhood so decided to give it a try!

I had purchased a regular <croissant/> and an <almond <croissant/>/>.

The <croissants/> were very flaky however I can't say I was too pleased with the regular <croissant/> as it had a burnt taste to it (which I really don't care for).

The <almond <croissant/>/> was really good, I would go back for that one. They had a beautiful display of sweets which I would like to go back to try.
