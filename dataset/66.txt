This place is really good! The best restaurant in the area! The food there is really tasty - especially the <<Ahi <Tuna/>/> <Club <sandwich/>/>/>, <<Lobster/> <Ravioli/>/> and the <<tandoori <chicken/>/> <flat <bread/>/>/>.

They also have mock <chicken/> for those who are vegetarians.

Gorgeous patio for the summer time.
