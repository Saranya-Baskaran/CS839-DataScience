I have eaten at several of these chains, every time thinking that perhaps this chance will be a bit better and honestly, this food is so underwhelming, I just give up at this point. The <meat/> is bland and often dry and overcooked, served with <rice/> and a <salad/> (generic <lettuce/> with <ranch/> dressing-type stuff) and their <naan/> tastes like cardboard. The rest of the stuff is edible, but the <naan/> is just plain atrocious. I have had Afghani food in other locations and it's flavourful and delicious. This does not hold up. I guess it's take out quality, so a sort of McDonald's version of Afghan food, but I'd take a <Big Mac/> any day over this stuff. Bleh.
