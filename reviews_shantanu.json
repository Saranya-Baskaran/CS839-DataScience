two in particular that get me salivating every time grilled mushrooms and onions. that alone should warrant a fourth star especially since they dont cost an extra couple bucks a pop like most places.

the foil around your burger and peeling it away like the burritos from chipoodle. this will guarantee that all those slippery little grilled mushroom and onion tidbits stay in place because theyre

"great place to bring dogs its really a dog place that you bring your humans pas soon as we walked in my dog was greeted with treats he was so excited to explore the store...there are  seats that you can sit and have your coffee while your dog lounges in the dog bed in front of you. truth  this really a store for dogs not so much for humans even though they offer coffee and tea  but just a handful of choices nothing crazy  the great part is my dog is very picky when it comes to his treats and he really likes the one we had purchased here. guess we will be back for more...", "foodItems":

friend and i had each ordered a <ginger beer/> which came out at two separate times it was almost as if they had to go in the back and make it themselves  thats how long it took.there is absolutely no vegetarian options except for the one cold noodle  the mushroom bun is not vegetarian.the <pork belly bun/> was nothing special  just a piece of meat with the bun. for my vegetarian friend we had ordered the bun plain so she could experience it as well and they literally just gave it to us plain with no sauce no kimchi.the momofuko ramen was awful. it was bland and mushy. after a few bites i couldnt handle eating anymore.momofuko is not the place to go if you want real ramen. ive had better experience with instant noodles.", "foodItems": ["ginger beer", "noodle", "mushroom bun", "pork

had asked and the hostess said yes we do have glutenfree items that are not just salads. just let the server know when you come in.excited to find another glutenfree place in town my friends and i show up for the reservation. upon arrival the server was really nice and friendly. when we had asked about the glutenfree options the answer was unfortunately as we do not cook our foods separately the only glutenfree items are salads. which was a disppointment to us as we had specifically asked if there were glutenfree items that werent salads on the menu.so we decided to just order a couple of apps and drinks as we have been sitting there for quite some time and it wasnt the servers fault that there wasnt any glutenfree items we felt bad to just get up and leave. in reading the reviews
