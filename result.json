My friend and I had each ordered a <<ginger/> beer/>, which came out at two separate times (it was almost as if they had to go in the back and make it themselves - that's how long it took).\n\nThere is absolutely no vegetarian options, except for the one cold <noodle/> - the <mushroom <bun/>/> is not vegetarian.\n\nThe <<pork/> belly <bun/>/> was nothing special - just a piece of <meat/> with the <bun/>. For my vegetarian friend, we had ordered the <bun/> plain so she could experience it as well, and they literally just gave it to us plain, with no <sauce/>, no <kimchi/>.\n\nThe Momofuko <ramen/> was awful. It was bland and mushy. After a few bites, I couldn't handle eating anymore.\n\nMomofuko is not the place to go if you want real <ramen/>. I've had better experience with instant <noodles/>.": [

It was much more akin to <ice cream/> and the flavour selection wasn't huge. \n\nThat said, they have some interesting flavours. I personally tried <Twix/> and birthday <cake/> and they were both very good. The more traditional flavour I tried (<creme caramel/>) was a little boring and lacked flavour. \n\nMy husband had the <strawberry/>, <Skor/> and <chocolate/>. All fine, none blew me away.\n\nOh well, no biggie.\n\nSo, since this place is about the <cupcakes/>, you may be interested in the <cupcakes/>...well the taste was overall good, but it was a very oily <cupcake/>.

  "Our friends got the groupon for four people and took us along. I'm very pleased we went! Having never had Ethiopian food before, we were curious, but wary. The deal really helped us dive in.

The other appetizer was similar to an Indian <samosa/> (similar name too, but I can't remember exactly what it was called). They were stuff with <lentils/> and had a flaky shell. They were DELICIOUS. BUT, their appetizers were only made for three people, so there were only three of them! Seems silly when you offer a four person deal. \n\nIt would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon, so I'm not sure I would make this a regularly destination, but as I said, the <coffee/> was fantastic and it's a fun thing to try, especially with friends.

  "OK is sort of the perfect description of this place. It's fine...it's not great!\n\nWe went here on a Saturday night. It's literally a block away from where we live and we have somehow never been. We finally decided to go for it!\n\nThe atmosphere is fine. It's nice and clean and much larger than you would realize from the outside. The decor it a bit cheesy with faux Roman sculptures. \n\nService was very good. The waiter was quick with our drinks and food and was helpful with suggestions. \n\nNow to the food. My husband ordered the <<veal/> parm/> and I ordered a <pasta/> with <chicken/>. We ordered <brushetta/> as a starter. I noticed from the menu that, while a lot of selection, many of the <pasta/> dishes were a bit uninspired. A lot of very basic dishes. <Pasta/> with <mushrooms/> and red <sauce/>, or <pasta/> with <shrimp/> and <pesto/>, etc. I really enjoy creative combinations and flavours when I go to an Italian restaurant, because quite honestly, I can make the basic stuff at home...for a hell of a lot cheaper.\n\nNo <bread/> was served to our table, other than the <bread/> from our <brushetta/>. \n\nThe <brushetta/> wasn't great. The <tomato/> mixture on top was good, but the <bread/> wasn't properly toasted, so it got soggy and couldn't hold its shape. It kept falling apart when you picked it up. \n\nThe desserts really brought this place back for me. I had their homemade <creme brule/> and it was really excellent. On the menu it tells you which are made in-house and I would highly recommend getting one of those. \n\nOverall, it was quite expensive for pretty basic Italian food, so it didn't stun me.

We ordered the platter for two. Since we had never been, it felt like a good idea to try it ALL out. GREAT idea! We were delivered a platter of food that included two <schnitzels/>, two <<cabbage/> <rolls/>/>, 6 <perogies/> and some other sides. Little Swiss Chalet-sized <gravies/>, but instead we got two, huge bowls of <gravy/>. Needless to say, one bowl would have been more than enough for 2 people. They were only $1 apiece, so not the end of the world. \n\nPlenty of food for two people and a great sampler platter to see what they have and what you like.\n\nService was fast and good and everything was excellent. Totally recommend it and I'll be back. Just thinking about it is making me salivate!": [

  "Wowwww.  Okay, so - five star rating, not easy to get from me.  But this place HAS to be on my top ten favorite restaurants in Vegas as of this moment.  Their <hummus/> is out of this WORLD.  I actually liked it more than the <wrap/> that I had (which was definitely tasty!).  Seriously.  You have to go and try it for yourself.  It's a hidden gem.  You can easily miss it, even looking for it, as my date and I did.  The service is also good.  The people who work there are really nice, so that's of course part of the five star rating.  It's Mediterranean, so it might go without saying that there are vegetarian options aplenty, but I won't let it go unsaid.  Please, just do yourself a favor.  Go here and try it out yourself.

I'm a vegetarian, and they let me swap out the meat that was on the menu for a side dish, so I was able to make my meal even more healthy.

SO GOOD that it melts in your mouth - so soft and tender. If it wasn't because we had ordered so much food and this was the last main course that showed up, we would have devoured it.\n\nFor dessert, we had ordered the <Foie/> and <Nutella/>, as we thought this was very interesting.

Cupcake places seem to range from around the $2.25 mark to around $4\\<cupcake/>. So these guys fall somewhere in between.

Walked out with the following:\n- <carrot <cake/>/>\n- <ginger <spice <cookie/>/>/>\n- <spicy <chocolate <cookie/>/>/>\n- <gluten free <peanut <butter <cookie/>/>/>/>\n\nThe mini 5 inch <cake/> was a good size not overly priced at $7. Was a bit on the sweet side but wasn't terrible. Just make sure you have it with <tea/> or <coffee/> (with no sugar).\n\nThe <cookies/> were $1.75 a piece, average for the size of the <cookie/>. However they are the crunchy kind of <cookies/> so if you are looking for a soft chewy <cookie/>, you should skip it.\n\nOverall not bad, will be back to try other stuff!

She ordered a <pasta/> dish and I ordered a <pizza/>. \n\nWhile we waited for the main course, we were given a basket and soft <bread/> and <oil/> and vinegar\n\nOur food came out and both dishes were DELICIOUS! The <pasta/> was great, the <sauce/> was especially good. The <pizza/> had <mozzarella/> and <veggies/>...<<goat/> <cheese/>/> on <pizza/> = perfecto! \n\nTurns out that this is not the first time I have had food from here. The same friend, used these guys to cater a party she had. She had some large trays of <pasta/> and I remember really enjoying them...you know, as far as catered food goes (to please everyone, they had gotten <pastas/> on the plainer side). \n\nI think this is a good, solid place. Prices are what you would expect for the food and area.\n\nWhy missing one star?

  "I was so surprised to see the negative reviews of this place, after having just had such a good experience there! \n\nFor my main I ordered the <Penne Gorgonzola/>, which was also fabulous! The members of my partied ordered the <<veal/> parmesan/> (but <grilled <veggies/>/> instead of the <pasta/>), and the <salmon/>.\n\nAltogether my meal came to $50 (tip included), which I think is more than I would spend on a normal dinner out, but not crazy. Also note though that I did not pay for the <wine/> and did not order any other drinks. That would obviously have increased the price. \n\nThe restaurant atmosphere is nothing special, but I'm disenchanted with the trendy spaces and pretentiously presented food that isn't half as good, so this wasn't a concern for me. The restaurant was clean and comfy, but the furniture was a little on the older side (like the dining chairs you would see in your fussy grandmother's home) and fake paintings on the walls.    \n\nSo, was it perfect? Well as I said, the salad was probably just average and the atmosphere also just average, but those did not pose major problems. I would ultimately give this place 4-1\\/2, but since I can't and this leaned more to the good than anything remotely bad, it gets a 5! I would go back in a heartbeat!": [

  "I am surprised at the people complaining about the service, because we found the service to be fine. Especially given how busy and cramped it was. There were no tables, but they got us seats at the bar. The music was maybe a little loud, but I enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening. The place looks like a dive, it's a total hole in the wall, with no signs to speak of, but I liked the weird atmosphere of weird, old \"ghetto blasters\" on the walls and pics of Arnold in Terminator. It's random, just go with it...\n\nBut the food....OH the FOOD! We were told that the <poutine/> was a must have, so I ordered that and the <bulgogi <steak/>/>, while my friend ordered the <mackerel/>. It arrived raw, on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it. My friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting, with a delicious marinade. Next came by <bulgogi <sandwich/>/>. Fresh, delicious <bread/>. Was very pleased. Finally the \"<poutines/>\" arrived. I should say that it was not what we were expecting. It doesn't matter okay....this stuff was HEAVEN! Both my friend and I took a bite and looked at each other...and proclaimed our new favourite food. \n\nOther people in our party got the <wings/>, which looked amazing and they said they were and The Loosey, which was also proclaimed as delicious. So basically there were no wrong moves. The drink menu was very adventurous...more so than we were, because we didn't take the plunge, although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them. And splitting the bill for my friend with two others (her birthday), my two \"tapas\" and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $30. The prices are extremely reasonable...and honestly once you try this stuff...I mean, I don't want to give them any ideas, but I would have paid more for that fine, fine food. I will be back.

  "Well, we decided on a whim that we wanted Mexican food and we called around to some places that were highly rated and no seats were available. One of my favs, Chimichanga's, has disappeared, so we got to a point where we were just calling around to see WHO could take us. Finally...La Revolucion answered!\n\nWe walked in and were greeted with....a dishwasher, sitting in the middle of the floor. Sort of strange...maybe some kitchen renos? We walked to meet our friends and their table and were informed that the reservations were not made, or were forgotten and the waitress had had to kick out a single guy from the table and he was eating at the bar. Maybe he was lucky, because the table was SO sticky underneath that my shoes were sticking to the ground. I mean STICKING!\n\nShe took our drink orders and then gave us our drinks and walked away. It took us another 15 minutes before we could place our order. Around the table we ordered two <burritos/>, one plate of <tacos/> and one <quesadilla/> and <guacamole/> bites (which is basically <nachos/> and <guac/>). \n\nThe <guac/> came out fast, and was quite good, but we then waited for almost forty minutes for our food!\n\n<Burritos/> were a bit bland. Needs some <sauce/> in, or on top. <Quesadillas/> were the same...nothing special. The <tacos/> got favorable reviews, but again, nothing to write home about. \n\nI think this place has potential. People in the area like it and it has a nice vibe to it...or would, had we had better service and less stickiness and washers sitting around. I feel like the space is just not being utilized and that's a shame. \n\nI WOULD have giving this place two stars, but the extra star was a result of the sangria, which is their \"secret recipe\" and were amazing. I had two actually.\n\nAnyway, if I was in the area, I might stop in again, as everything was fine, but I don't think I'll be making any special trips to go there in the future.

  "This gem is tucked away in an alley at Green Valley's District area, but don't let that fool you - going here, you almost feel like you're no longer in Las Vegas, Nevada, but rather in a different part of the world.  It has a romantic, intimate feel.  The food is delicious, and the drinks are fantastic.  I came here yesterday to meet someone, and a friend of mine - Dominique - was bartending.  Others have commented on her ability to make incredible drinks, and I will add on to those positive comments!  Whether you ask for something on the menu, or something not on the menu, it will be one of the best drinks you get in all of Vegas.  I've lived here a little while, and I can testify with the <ice <teas/>/>!  They are thinking of adding live music soon, out on the little patio out front; with the right artists, this can only add to the experience.  Definitely recommended!": [

  "My sister told me that Origin was well known for their delicious brunches, so we made a trip there to see if this was the case. \nOrigin is pretty new in our area and is very large, but nicely decorated. My only comment would be the washrooms, which feature communal sinks, the kind you find in elementary schools, where you step on the thing at the bottom and water comes out all around. Besides not being very effective to quickly wash hands, it's also wasteful if you're the only one there. Strange concept. Throw back, but not necessarily one wants to remember during their brunch.  \n\nNow onto the important part...the food and service.\n\nService started out alright and then immediately got very slow. It took some time to get our drink orders and then took a LONG time to get our actual orders. \n\nWe also shared a plate of <biscuits/> with their preserves. These were delicious.\n\nApparently my meal was the one that took the longest. The others got their food and we still waited for five minutes before mine came out. Who knew it would take so long to put a couple of pieces of <bread/> on a plate and cover them with <blueberry/> preserves?\n\nMy sister said her <tostada/> was quite good. My <toast/> was nothing special. On top of each other with <whipped <cream/>/>. \n\nNothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay. This was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy.\nBecause the brunch itself didn't blow me away, food shortages and service, I'm not sure if I would bother with brunch again.

  "While I really enjoyed the <noodles/>, their signature <<pork/> buns/>, which seemed to be something everyone orders and raves about, I did not like at all.

I couldn't taste the <cucumbers/> and didn't see any evidence of <scallions/>. It was basically just pure fat, wrapped in a bland \"<bun/>\".

I was a little disappointed that the <pork/> was <ground pork/>, instead of <shredded pork/>. It made the dish seem cheaper and less inspired. \n\nI liked the atmosphere, but the seating is at long tables and so you share the space with whoever they place next to you. The seats are long benches, so if you're in the middle of the bench, you have to lift your leg over...I saw guys struggling to do this...now imagine being a girl, wearing a skirt and having to do this.

  "This place is a bit of an adventure...at least for me. I've never had <charcuterie/> before and I'm not generally a big meat eater, so this was a little out of the box. That said, I like trying to be adventurous and trying new things, so when are visiting friends suggested we give it a go, we went for it. Dinner service is open at 6pm, so we agreed we'd arrive at 6pm. We got there at about 6:15....there was already a HUGE wait for a table, but we managed to wrangle seats at the bar. \n\nThe four of us ordered a bunch of dishes to split between ourselves. We tried the <charcuterie/>.\n\nFinally we had the <tacos/>, which was probably the more \"normal\" thing we had. I actually thought those were my favorite. Wish it was one of the more exciting things, but nope. Those tacos were excellent.  \n\nOverall the food was very good. SOMEONE knows what they are doing. However, it is quite a pricey place and as I said, sometimes the flavours overpower the meat, or the meat just isn't even necessary. Sometimes you're paying extra for fancy meat dishes that don't even need the meat, or where you can't TASTE the meat. \n\nThose are the only criticisms, but I wouldn't let that keep you from trying this place...but only if you're willing to go out on a limb a bit and as something different. This isn't a go-to place, but it's a fun place to have gone to! \n\nOh...PS - They don't accept credit cards. Only debit or cash.": [

Their specialty are <mousse/> drinks - which we had no idea what exactly it was. So when we asked the staff, they said it was some sort of <cheese/>. \n\nFor a Sunday afternoon, they were also out of <grass <jelly/>/> and <pudding/>, which are ingredients in quite a few of their drinks (so not sure how that works).\n\nThe service is really bad, they don't understand English so when you asked them about the menu items, they can't really explain what they are.\n\nWe had ordered the following:\n- <<slush/> <mango/>/> (came with <tapioca/> and <mousse/>)\n- <<peach/> <ice <tea/>/>/>\n- <roasted <oolong <milk/> <tea/>/>/>\n- <supernova <<kumquat/> <lemonade/>/>/>\n\nAnd when we asked what the difference between a <supernova <<kumquat/> <lemonade/>/>/> under the galaxy drinks section (which are supposed to be layered drinks), and the <<kumquat/> <lemonade/>/>, they said it had a layer of <blue <mousse/>/> - so we were like ok we will try it then. But what came was just a bigger cup size of the <<kumquat/> <lemonade/>/>. When we asked them again, they said it was just a size difference, that's what makes it supernova - which is pretty dumb to me as on the menu both items had the same two size choices of regular or large. \n\nThe <<mango/> <slush/>/> and the <roasted <oolong <milk/> <tea/>/>/> wasn't bad. But the other two was not that great. The <tea/> had a big floral taste that overpowered everything. There was no <peach/> taste in the <<peach/> <ice <tea/>/>/>. The <kumquat/> one had no <kumquat/> taste and was just bitter from the <lime/> and it tasted like it had no <sugar/> in it at all.\n\nI guess if you need a non-busy place to use WIFI and work, then this is the place, no one wants to come here.\n\nAlso - their gimmick also seems to be the lightbulb drinks, which were intriguing to us, but you are not allowed to take the lightbulb home...\n\nWe will definitely not be returning...": [

We went in and looked at the selection and decided what we wanted and when the person behind the counter asked to take our order and we said we wanted to sit down. He wouldn't take the order and instead had us sit down and look at menus. We explained we knew what we wanted already, but he said he'd be back in a minute. This was fine, we weren't in a rush, but we were both a little confused by the ten minutes we sat there waiting for him. \nWhen he finally came out, as we were ordering, his cell phone rang and he took the call and walked away, around the corner of the building. We waited for about five minutes for him to finish his call and he finally took our order. Umm...that was some pretty shocking un-professionalism, but we laughed it off and ordered. \n\nI ordered basic New York <cheesecake/> and my friend ordered an <<apple/> <cheesecake/>/>. <Cheesecakes/> were good, (she really liked her) and we ordered <cappuccino/> Knowing it wasn't fresh sort of took away from the experience. \nAnyway, we had a fine time here and the desserts are good, but not great.

  "My husband and myself went to Sail and were looking for a place to pick up some dinner...just grab and go, since I had no groceries at home...but also didn't have the energy to go grocery shopping. I lay in a hammock (I was in Sail, what else would I do?) I researched places to get sandwiches in the area and this place came up and had good reviews. I mentioned to my husband as we were checking out and the check out guy said, \"There is this good place nearby named Ricci's.\" That sealed the deal.

  "We booked a reservation at Smith for Summerlicious. One of the major problems was finding it though. Almost every one in our party either didn't see it initially (it's sort of nondescript looking), or weren't sure which door\\/staircase was the proper one to get inside. \nOnce inside though, it's an eclectic blend of vintage meets white-washed industrial. If you didn't know that was a style, neither did I, but it totally works. There was a great blend of music in the background...it was a mix, probably an employee just made it, but it was great mood music. I want that mix CD! \nMy brother had called several weeks ago to make a reservation and somehow they didn't have it. Apparently it's an answering service for reservations and they say they call you back if they can't accommodate you. He never received a call back, so the assumption was that the reservation was alright. Unfortunately, as I said, there was no reservation. The staff apologized profusely though and luckily there was space and they set up a table for us right away. \nWe ordered from the drink menu and I will say that they drinks are very expensive. The wine is what you would expect and the mixed drink (at least the one I had, the <Smith Lemonade/>) was fantastic, but it was also $12, which is steep even for Toronto bar standards. \nAs I said, we ordered from the Summerlicious menu. I have heard many comments online that people are feeling disillusioned with Summerlicious because so many restaurants give you the cheapest options and it's not worth the cost. This was NOT the case with Smith at all. There were several great options to choose from and the food was excellent. I had the <curried <carrot/> <soup/>/>, which was spicy but great. Every one else in my party also enjoyed their various appetizers. My main course was a <Georgian Bay whitefish/>, which was done perfectly, just crispy enough on the outside and flaky on the inside. The <<pork/> chops/> were also raved about. There was also a <risotto/>, which two of the three people who ordered it really enjoyed. You can't take that last guy (brother again) too seriously, since he's a very picky eater. \nThe desserts were all good, however the fudge ice cream, is really just <<chocolate/> <ice cream/>/>, nothing special. The <lemon <curd/>/> tasted like <<lemon/> <pie/>/> filling and was delicious and the <<bread/> pudding/> was heavenly! Seriously, it was SO good. \nI think everyone left feeling really satisfied. \nIt did take a long time to get the food. This wasn't a problem for us, since we were there to converse and I understand that great food may take some time, but if you are really hungry, or looking for a quicker meal, this isn't the right choice.\nBasically it lost of star because of the lost reservation and lack of visibility from the street. Also, we weren't thrilled with the washrooms. Besides the fact that they are co-ed, which is a little weird, there is one, large sink and a foot peddle to operate it. Since only one person can step on it at a time, you have to wait for that person to finish, before you can wash your hands, which starts to cause a bit of a back-up if more than two people are in the washroom. Also, the hand dryers were weak\\/not working. \nThat said, I wouldn't let a slightly annoying bathroom stop me from coming here! This is a nice, little place!": [

As a result, I haven't bothered going or ordering from there in well over a year. Well, today I had a craving for Mexican and since Toronto has a huge lack of Mexican restaurant choices and because I'm busy working at home, my husband and myself decided to order from BarBurrito's delivery. I should also mention that if you go to justeat.ca BarBurrito charges $7 delivery. Orderit.ca has no charge. Don't know if that's the ordering website or the restaurant, but it's a tip for anyone who decides to order from this place.\n\nSo I went ahead and placed the order...only to have it be \"rejected\" by BarBurrito, because they are busy right now. This restaurant is listed on two different food ordering sites, but they won't deliver if they don't feel inclined?? SERIOUSLY! \n\nSo I have learned my lesson.

  "When deciding where to go to Valentine's Day dinner, we decided to try something a little different and have an \"experience\" , instead of just dinner. So we made reservations at O. Noir. Overall, it was a good time and a good laugh. \n\nOne recommendation: Maybe don't wear your BEST clothes to this place, as there is a very really possibility that you will drop food on yourself. \n\nTHE WAY IT WORKS: For those of you who don't know - You enter into a lounge with brick walls and dim lights. You pre-order your meal and can order drinks from the bar there. THen you are introduced to your waiter(ess), who is visually impaired, and are led into a pitch black room and seated at your table. \n\nAnd it IS pitch black. You can't see your hand in front of your face. Your eyes never adjust and there is a sort of entrance way into the room, so you never even get light from the door when someone enters the room. \n\nYou are then served your food and have to go about the task of trying to eat it, while blind. This is a challenge, because you can't see the food and because even when you THINK you've finally speared a <veggie/>, for example, when you bring the fork to your mouth, you realized you've lost it somewhere along the way. Usually into your lap. \n\nThis is DEFINITELY an experience, does an interesting job at raising awareness, but here are my issues with this place: The food was good, but not great. This becomes more apparent when you can't even see the presentation of the food and are reliant entirely on taste. It needs to taste GREAT. This was distinctly forgettable food. \n\nI found that I liked it to try once and say I've done it, but it's gimmicky and that doesn't translate well into a place that will become a go-to favorite.

  "So, below is is original review, which was accompanies by 4 stars, however I've decided to revise it. \n\nAs I said below, when I went to Moroco, it was expensive, but very delicious for a treat. So I decided that I wanted to have my birthday dessert there. I called up to make a reservation for about 10 people. I was informed that for groups of over ten, there is a requirement that every person spends $48! \n\nI kept the reservation for a day to see how many people were actually going to confirm coming out, but since everyone confirmed, I had to call back and cancel my reservation, because I do not want my guests to be obliged to spend $50 on dessert, after we have already had dinner! The girl on the phone said that it usually worked out, because once people had dessert and a drink, it worked out to be enough. As I said below, let's round up and say dessert is $20...so she's saying their drinks are $28!??! \n\nI have wanted to go to Moroco for my birthday since the summer, but that was before I realized how pretentious they are! No thanks! <Chocolate/> is great there, but only go with a couple of people, otherwise you'll have to pay the price!\n\n* * * * *\n\n(Original reviews: Oh my gosh, this place is to DIE for.

This place has prices on the high end of breakfast place, on weekends they are very crowded and it will take some time to be seated and the food is alright. \n\nThe last time I went, I was with my husband and we went in the door to a huge crowd. There was no wait to be seated sign, but we guessed correctly and waited. Problem is that you pay and wait in the same place, which meant people were coming and going in a very small area. It was chaos for awhile.

Either their mild is just VERY spicy and I would hate to try their actual spicy, or they made a mistake.

The <rice/> was bland however...or the spice from the <curry/> killed my tastebuds. \n\nMy husband chose a <burger/>, which was overall very good, although they charged him two dollars each for <bacon/> and <cheese/> on the <burger/>, which is expensive when your <burger/> is already $15. Not sure the bacon added anything, but the <cheese/>, I'll admit was really good on this <burger/>. \n\nAtmosphere and Service: Service was fine.

This show is a heart attack in the making.\n\nIt also gives you cravings...often for food you can't possibly get, because they're making some crazy thing across the country that you cannot possibly find a duplicate for. \n\nNaturally I got a crazy craving for <fish/> and <chips/>...\n\nI did a lot of looking around, before I found this place, which wasn't too far away and was, most importantly, open! \n\nThis is a quirky place, with wood panelling on the walls and some random <fish/> hung around the place.\n\nWe came for the F&Cs though! \n\nWe ordered the single piece, which was MORE than enough food. Quite expensive though. You're looking at around $15\\/meal of one large piece of <fish/> and some <fries/>.\n\nIt was good, but it wasn't great. Worst of all, the <tartar sauce/> came in sealed packages....ugh.\n\nService was fine. No complaints. The waitress did her job...took our order, gave us our food and gave us the bill....that was her job and she did no more and no less.\n\nThe restaurant ambiance wasn't there, the food wasn't special and the prices weren't good.": [
