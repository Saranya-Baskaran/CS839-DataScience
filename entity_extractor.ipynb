Almost every one in our party either didn't see it initially (it's sort of nondescript looking), or weren't sure which door\\\\/staircase was the proper one to get inside. \\nOnce inside though, it's an eclectic blend of vintage meets white-washed industrial. If you didn't know that was a style, neither did I, but it totally works. There was a great blend of music in the background...it was a mix, probably an employee just made it, but it was great mood music. I want that mix CD! \\nMy brother had called several weeks ago to make a reservation and somehow they didn't have it. Apparently it's an answering service for reservations and they say they call you back if they can't accommodate you. He never received a call back, so the assumption was that the reservation was alright. Unfortunately, as I said, there was no reservation. The staff apologized profusely though and luckily there was space and they set up a table for us right away. \\nWe ordered from the drink menu and I will say that they drinks are very expensive. The wine is what you would expect and the mixed drink (at least the one I had, the <Smith Lemonade/>) was fantastic, but it was also $12, which is steep even for Toronto bar standards. \\nAs I said, we ordered from the Summerlicious menu. I have heard many comments online that people are feeling disillusioned with Summerlicious because so many restaurants give you the cheapest options and it's not worth the cost. This was NOT the case with Smith at all. There were several great options to choose from and the food was excellent. I had the <curried <carrot/> <soup/>/>, which was spicy but great. Every one else in my party also enjoyed their various appetizers. My main course was a <Georgian Bay whitefish/>, which was done perfectly, just crispy enough on the outside and flaky on the inside. The <<pork/> chops/> were also raved about. There was also a <risotto/>, which two of the three people who ordered it really enjoyed. You can't take that last guy (brother again) too seriously, since he's a very picky eater. \\nThe desserts were all good, however the fudge ice cream, is really just <<chocolate/> <ice cream/>/>, nothing special. The <lemon <curd/>/> tasted like <<lemon/> <pie/>/> filling and was delicious and the <<bread/> pudding/> was heavenly! Seriously, it was SO good. \\nI think everyone left feeling really satisfied. \\nIt did take a long time to get the food. This wasn't a problem for us, since we were there to converse and I understand that great food may take some time, but if you are really hungry, or looking for a quicker meal, this isn't the right choice.\\nBasically it lost of star because of the lost reservation and lack of visibility from the street. Also, we weren't thrilled with the washrooms. Besides the fact that they are co-ed, which is a little weird, there is one, large sink and a foot peddle to operate it. Since only one person can step on it at a time, you have to wait for that person to finish, before you can wash your hands, which starts to cause a bit of a back-up if more than two people are in the washroom.

THen you are introduced to your waiter(ess), who is visually impaired, and are led into a pitch black room and seated at your table. \\n\\nAnd it IS pitch black. You can\\'t see your hand in front of your face. Your eyes never adjust and there is a sort of entrance way into the room, so you never even get light from the door when someone enters the room. \\n\\nYou are then served your food and have to go about the task of trying to eat it, while blind.

       " \"was always intrigued of this place when I pass by on the streetcar. Finally decided to try this place out this past summer. Read the reviews and everyone had lots of good things to say.\\n\\none of my friends has dietary restrictions and needs to have gluten-free items. When I had called to make the dinner reservation, I had asked and the hostess said, yes, we do have gluten-free items that are not just <salads/>. Just let the server know when you come in.\\n\\nexcited to find another gluten-free place in town, my friends and I show up for the reservation. Upon arrival, the server was really nice and friendly. When we had asked about the gluten-free options, the answer was unfortunately as we do not cook our foods separately, the only gluten-free items are <salads/>. Which was a disppointment to us, as we had specifically asked if there were gluten-free items that weren't <salads/> on the menu.\\n\\nSo we decided to just order a couple of apps and drinks as we have been sitting there for quite some time, and it wasn't the server's fault that there wasn't any gluten-free items (we felt bad to just get up and leave). \\n\\nIn reading the reviews, everyone thought very highly of the <mac and <cheese/>/> and <poutine/>, we had ordered that to try. It wasn't bad, but not sure what the hype was about. Definitely pretty rich and filling and made for sharing!\": [{'salads': ['salads']},\n",
