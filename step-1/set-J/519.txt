The next time I want microwaved <hot wings/> and <pizza crust/> that tastes like a water and flour slurry made love to a bland piece of cardboard, I'll be sure to hit up Otto's. I had to seriously blast those <hot wings/> in the broiler to make them even remotely crispy and even then they were still rubbery. The pizza was so overwhelmingly mediocre we tossed the rest after dinner instead of refrigerating it. 

Also, calling in an order and then showing up 20 minutes later to be greeted with, "Oh, we didn't start your order because we couldn't call the number you gave us back," when they clearly had caller ID and the number was misheard one off, was new to me. So was sitting there for an additional 20 minutes and watching them microwave a plate of <hot wings/>. Never seen that before either. I don't know how you're still in business, Otto's. Not even collegiate nostalgia will get me to stop there again.
