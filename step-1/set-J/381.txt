A girlfriend and I found our way here, and it happened to be happy hour.  We couldn't believe the prices, especially for Tivoli Village!  The <wine/> was so good, and the food was delicious, as well.  I think the guy who made our food was also our server, which I appreciated, since I really enjoyed what I ate, and got to tell the chef in person how Much I enjoyed it.  He is not only a great cook, but an attentive and engaging server.  I can't wait to come back here again!
