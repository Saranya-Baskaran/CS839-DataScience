Really great pastries in charlotte! I had a <chocolate croissant/> and some other treats that I can't remember the name of. My sister had the <bread pudding/> which was filled with <coconut/>, <raisins/>, and <pecans/>. That was to die for, they serve it warm which it takes a minute to heat up, but still worth  the wait!  Their prices on <pastries/> weren't bad the highest priced items were their bigger items like the <muffins/> for around close to $5. The decor in the shop was very unique, there wasn't one thing the same.  The shops tables and chairs are vintage and so are the decorations. Overall it's a great place to go to study or have <desert/>.  Plus they are open 24\/hrs! Would defiantly go back and try something different!
