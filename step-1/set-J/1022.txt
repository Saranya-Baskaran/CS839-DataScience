I spotted this place a few weeks ago (I'm new in town), and couldn't wait to return when I ran out of my <soy protein/> because they had a <rice-based protein/> that I'd tried and loved before.  They have a fantastic selection of <protein powders/>, bars and supplements.  Their prices on <protein powder/> are lower than what I've seen on Amazon (at least for the one I was looking for), and I agree with another reviewer about the associates - they are helpful without being pushy.  VERY important in any store, but especially here, where there are so many comparable products and it's vital to have someone who can help you with your individual needs and not talk you into buying something that you don't really want or need.  I didn't really utilize that, since I knew what I wanted, but I did notice it with other customers who were there at the same time as I was.  Definitely coming back here!  Thank you, Vegas Discount Nutrition!
