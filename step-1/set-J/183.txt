I'm new to the area and stopped in here a few days ago to pick up a <coffee/> maker.
This has got to be one of the largest Walmarts I've been to.
It looks to me like this place has everything.
Although very busy, like most Walmarts, it wasn't as busy as many I've seen. 
Being the short tempered guy I am I was able to get in and hot before my blood pressure had risen too much.
It also seemed the clientele was a notch or two above some of the other locations I've visited.
