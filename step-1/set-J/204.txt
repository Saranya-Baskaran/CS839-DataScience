A few of us from our company had lunch here today. We had planned on eating at the buffet,  but were informed it was an hour and a half wait,  so we opted for the Hash House.

I had the small order of <chicken/> and <waffles/>. This was the first time I've tried this combination of sweet and salty. I've seen <chicken/> and <waffles/> reviewed on different food shows and it looked interesting. Apparently it's a popular item down south.

I found it good and I'd order it again. 

One of my companions had the <meatloaf/> and he said it was awesome!

I did notice other patrons food orders were very large. So you apparently get your moneys worth here and the prices seemed good as well. Most items on the menu seemed to be around ten dollars.

My one complained was that it was quite a long wait to get our food.

Although I wasn't really wowed by this place I did find the food satisfactory and the prices were excellent. The staff was friendly and the place was clean.

I'd definitely give this place a try again.
