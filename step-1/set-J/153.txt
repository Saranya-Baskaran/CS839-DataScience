Been here twice now. Always go with my parents when they come to visit. Nothing particularly special about this place and I find some prices fine, while others on the expensive side (their <salads/> are very expensive and they don't include a protein which is a considerable amount more, for example), and I find their tables are very low (weird, but annoying when trying to eat some things...like my <soup/>), but the food has been consistently good, as has the service and the atmosphere nice. Wish they had more in terms of a kids menu, but we'll be back.
