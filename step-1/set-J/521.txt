Best place for <pho/> I have found in the valley. Get the #1 with everything: tripe, tendon, fatty flank, <meatballs/> and the regular <beef/>. Don't let the ingredients intimidate you. It's out of this world good!

If <pho/> is in your future, be forewarned that the serving sizes are massive. I have never been able to polish off an entire bowl. So come extra hungry and skip the tempting <spring rolls/> (also delicious with a killer spicy <peanut sauce/>). Because if you've ever made the mistake of trying to stretch out a bowl of pho by taking half of it home, you know the disappointment that comes along with that cloudy bowl of watered down leftovers. <Rice noodles/> just don't hold up well. Le sigh.
