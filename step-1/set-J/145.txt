Small location, with some seating out front. Hard to get into and place order and wait to receive it. Everyone ends up smooshed together and waiting and they certainly take their time. 
I asked if they did flavoured <lattes/>. Nope, they do what they list on their menu. No more. I ordered a regular <latte/>. Nothing special. I have tried a few food items here and nothing was particularly good. I'd take a pass. There are WAY better <coffee/> shops in the mall.
