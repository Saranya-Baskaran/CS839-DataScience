I really want to give this place four stars. Greg would string me up by my toenails and make me repent for my burger sins if he knew I was reviewing his favorite place as just a three star burger joint. But I can't abide paying ten to twelve bucks for a fast food <burger/>, <fries/> and a drink. That's crazy cakes. 

Granted the <burger/> is juicy perfection, grilled to order with as many custom toppings as your hardening arteries can handle. They have two in particular that get me salivating every time: <grilled mushrooms/> and <onions/>. That alone should warrant a fourth star, especially since they don't cost an extra couple bucks a pop like most places. But it's still a six freakin' dollar <burger/>. If they hadn't plastered their walls with newspaper reviews exalting how cheap their eats were, I would probably be a bit more accommodating, but more than ten bucks for a fast foodie <burger/> meal just ain't on.
