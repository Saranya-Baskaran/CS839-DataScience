Only three stars for The Lounge, mostly because of how you smell when you leave Excalibur: reeking of cigarette smoke.  It's not unique to the lounge itself, but a general casino thing.  I've played shows in this lounge, and the sound guy is friendly and can handle us a-okay.  There is one waitress who gets our drinks for us, and I asked for straight up pineapple juice (not a drinker, myself); and next time I was there, she asked if I wanted that again.  Love that she remembers!  (I didn't say no...)  Usually there are pretty good crowds that gather, though not always wildly excited to be there.  Not too shabby, I suppose...
