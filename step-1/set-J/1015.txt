Came here to see a friend sing, and really enjoyed the whole experience.  This place has a wonderful atmosphere - both upbeat and intimate at the same time.  I tried one of the <cocktails/> - it was on the stronger side, so I admit I didn't finish it - but the <red wine/> I had two glasses of (by suggestion of a friend) was fantastic.  The food was also really good!  I had the <eggplant parmesan/> (and much to my lament, I forgot to take a picture of it before I ate it) - delicious!!  This is one of the few places in town that features jazz musicians on a regular basis, so if you like that vibe, this is the place for you!
