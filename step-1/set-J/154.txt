Listen, these <bagels/> are good...very good, but they didn't blow me away. 

Anyway, it was a fun place to go to and pick up a snack. Not a great place to get drinks to go with the snack, since they only seem to sell whole cartons of <juice/>. 

Glad I tried it, would try it again, but probably wouldn't go out of my way to do so. 

BUT that's me...people seem to be die hard Montreal <bagel/> fans and if that's you, I think you hold this place in much higher esteem! All the power to ya!
