A friend and I visited here after a long day out in Death Valley.  We were tired and starving! I had the <black bean burger/> (fantastic!), with <tofu fries/>, and the <acai blueberry smoothie/>.  Everything I had was delicious, and I devoured it.  My friend had the <sweet potato fries/> - good, but I was glad I got the <tofu fries/> (I'm a lifelong vegetarian, so I love tofu!).  The food is good and the people who work there are super nice.  Will be coming back here again.  = )
