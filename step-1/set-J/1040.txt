Very good <tacos/> and <burritos/>!  Went for my sister's 21st birthday! The waiter was very helpful and patient with us! She even brought out our <cake/> for us from the freezer with a candle! The plates were very reasonably priced, $12 for my <carne asada tacos/>. They were a little bit spicy but I'm a baby when it comes to spicy. The drinks were reasonably priced too for a <cocktail-cosmo/> $8 with their mid grade <liquor/>. We had an overall great experience! Would definitely go back.
