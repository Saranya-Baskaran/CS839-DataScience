The <burgers/> here were average. I tried the <veggie burger/> and found the consistency to be a little too soft and quite difficult to eat with how highly piled the other toppings were. Then saving grace were the fiery <peppers/> and <sauce/> that came in my <burger/> and really added the flavour. My tablemate enjoyed the <beef burger/> with <wild mushrooms/> but also felt that it was nothing special. The service was fantastic and all of the staff was extremely friendly! I wouldn't go out of my way to go again but maybe if I'm around crescent I'd pop in!
