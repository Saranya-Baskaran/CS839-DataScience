    "review": "z tejas exists for one reason and one reason alone to sell awesome margaritas at not so awesome prices that youll totally shell out for anyway because their massive strength will sucker punch you with the first sip and then bat you around like an orca playing with a baby seal right before going in for the kill seriously three of these things will have you giggling slurring declarations of love to the members of your party believing your sexiness status just gained  craving jack in the box tacos and possibly breaking a heel upon your exit they are a thing of beauty  and the reason why they enforce a three margarita limit unfortunately theyll run you  to  bucks depending on how much razzle dazzle youre going for  the sixth street margarita is the most basic frozen or on the rocks and is delicious  so is the z top shelf and the chambord and the frozen watermelon and the grand marnier and i think youre sensing the trend here and the food    well it exists so you dont leave in the condition discussed above  its not as good as the margaritas but once you have a couple youre really not going to care that much brunch is the best time to hit this place up and indulge in a three dollar mimosa their three dollar top shelf doityourself bloody mary bar with all the fixins including  beef jerky   stir sticks or the epic margaritas  the chicken and potato hash is decent but it used to be much better back when it was the savory sage chicken and potato hash and had how do you say actual flavor  now its just blah by comparison  well done blah  but blah all the same although mr  man loves it  so you may want to hit up the smothered burrito or jerk chicken salad instead both of which are delicious  happy hour is also a pretty good deal with one dollar off all drinks and half price appetizers  id recommend the cast iron skillet dumplings that are like crispy round asian pot stickers that come out sizzlin in sweet chile sauce or the tortilla soup which is done really really well here with avocado and lots of chunky chicken  but forget the food  its the backup vocals to the wailing showboat sex symbol of a lead singer that runs back stage for a mid show sex drug booze binge while his second tier standin entertains the crowd with a limp solo  the margaritas are bad ass and they know it  let em get a little saucy with ya  oh and the patio rocks almost as hard as the margaritas so make sure to be seated out there "

    "review": "i really want to give this place four stars  greg would string me up by my toenails and make me repent for my burger sins if he knew i was reviewing his favorite place as just a three star burger joint  but i cant abide paying ten to twelve bucks for a fast food burger fries and a drink  thats crazy cakes  granted the burger is juicy perfection grilled to order with as many custom toppings as your hardening arteries can handle  they have two in particular that get me salivating every time grilled mushrooms and onions  that alone should warrant a fourth star especially since they dont cost an extra couple bucks a pop like most places  but its still a six freakin dollar burger  if they hadnt plastered their walls with newspaper reviews exalting how cheap their eats were i would probably be a bit more accommodating but more than ten bucks for a fast foodie burger meal just aint on i do also like that they offer a mini version of their two patty big madre burger for the wimps like me out there  regardless i would recommend keeping the foil around your burger and peeling it away like the burritos from chipoodle  this will guarantee that all those slippery little grilled mushroom and onion tidbits stay in place because theyre seriously too good to get away  the french fries are also in the style that i like freshly fried up with the bejeezus salted out of them  ten billion times better than the fresh but somehow still super bland and lifeless matchsticks that in  out serves  the cajun style fries are just sprinkled with seasoned salt  a bit of a let down from what i was expecting but a nice change in pace since its usually curly fries that get the seasoned salt treatment  also if youre a limey barstard like me you can grab a bottle of malt vinegar from the side counter and use it to drown your fries  so good i also dig on the free peanuts  i realize this is a polarizing issue considering the risk of nut allergies out there but i like it  when i was a kid i used to judge the caliber of an establishment by whether or not i could throw peanut shells on the ground  sadly that has changed very little with the years because i still get a kick out of doing it  alright  ive talked myself into it  its getting an extra star  damn your scrumptious fare five guys  your hypnotic grease has me entranced "

    "review": "im of the opinion that breakfast is pretty hard to fuck up  if youre not ordering something hoity toity the following formula applies hot grilleggsmeatcarb breakfast  my stomach and i are proud to say inform you that j p  pancakes has mastered that formula  they even include some variables in the equation that will knock off your socks and spin them around your head its the small innocuous looking restaurant in a large strip mall sandwiched between an italian restaurant and whatever the hell was on the other side  its not much to look at but when the food is this good it really doesnt matter  just stick with it until your meal comes  and dont let the constant loop of incredibly shitty kyot style smooth jazz scare you away  theyre willing to turn the volume down because the waitresses think its pretty much shite as well theyre known for their pancakes duh but i wasnt really in the mood for a sweet breakfast  i will definitely be coming here the next time that urge strikes though  their oven baked fluffy cakes looked superb and come in apple blueberry strawberry banana german and german nutty varieties  wowzer  there were even more regular pancake and belgian waffle varieties as well as traditional breakfast combos and omelets with some pretty cool stuff in them like avocado or feta cheese  i opted for the hong kong omelet with sausage wild mushrooms onions monterey jack and cheddar cheese  ohmygod  it was delicious and huge  the mushrooms were gigantic like portabella size because they were diced into big old pieces and you could hardly discern the shape of them  the bacon was thick and crispy and the sausage was also delicious  mr  man got it on the side with his breakfast  lets just say it looked pretty phallic more like a bratwurst than a little link sausage  youll feel slightly dirty taking a succulent bite out this sucker which brings me to the homefries  they are quite possibly some of the best side order potatoes i have ever had with breakfast  crisp small little squares seasoned to perfection  they were delicious alone but perfection when sprinkled with hot sauce  im salivating just thinking of them right now  they were that freakin good its a little on the pricey side   for my omelet and homefries   for eggs meat and fries for breakfast the ambiance kinda sucks and its located in the hell of old people infested scottsdale suburbs side note we got to see some old biddy drive down the wrong part of the road twice but their mastery of the breakfast art is truly something to wonder at  if nothing else go for that  you wont walk away disappointed "

    "review": "opened by pickle barrel glow is meant to be this new healthy eating restaurant that ensures you do not over indulge on certain foods  they have burgers that are served bunless and a side of salad  so make sure you read the fine print prior to order to ensure you get what you want the food is ok not memorable  the atmosphere and decor is beautiful  and the service was not bad  after hearing all the horror stories i thought we would be getting terrible service they also have these  calories shooter glass desserts that are cute but also not memorable in taste i think this place is probably good for a drink for the atmosphere and decor but not so much for their food "

    "review": "when i was a kid i would eat a pile of plain noodles with butter on them while the rest of my family mowed down on real italian food  i think it had more to do with the fact that spaghetti given to a kiddo is more likely to end up on them than in them and tomato sauce hurts when it ends up in your eye  but in twentyodd years my palate has matured past the realm of bland noodles and into the realm of big girl flavors  i think thats why i was so disappointed by giuseppes  i ordered the smoked salmon with asparagus pasta thinking heck yeah lox me up and throw away the key instead i got the toddler special in disguise a big pile of noodles drowning in butter with flakes of salmon and asparagus floating throughout  ewwie  the noodles were freshly prepared since it was the weekend and were a doughy delight  its too bad they were marred by such a crap combination  i mean you cant even toss in some garlic onions or something vaguely resembling seasoning failure failure failure my boyfriends pasta carbonara was a thing of beauty  it is very difficult to find real carbonara in the valley  most places just toss together white sauce and bacon and call it a night  very few take the time to saute onions garlic and pancetta add steaming hot pasta raw egg and parmesan cheese and toss until it oozes together into drool inducing blob of yum  amazing good  its just odd that such contradictory dishes are on the same menu  we also had the garlic bread because what better to add to a giant pile of carbs than more bread it was passable  very dry and crispy more like crouton and topped with a delish garlicky spice infused oil  four tiny toastettes for four bucks though  not the greatest deal  i shall be back  ill just stay far far away from the noodly combos of questionable origin  p s   to all my winos out there corking fee of  bucks"

    "review": "ok is sort of the perfect description of this place. its fine...its not greatwe went here on a saturday night. its literally a block away from where we live and we have somehow never been. we finally decided to go for itthe atmosphere is fine. its nice and clean and much larger than you would realize from the outside. the decor it a bit cheesy with faux roman sculptures. service was very good. the waiter was quick with our drinks and food and was helpful with suggestions. now to the food. my husband ordered the veal parm and i ordered a pasta with chicken. we ordered brushetta as a starter. i noticed from the menu that while a lot of selection many of the pasta dishes were a bit uninspired. a lot of very basic dishes. pasta with mushrooms and red sauce or pasta with shrimp and pesto etc. i really enjoy creative combinations and flavours when i go to an italian restaurant because quite honestly i can make the basic stuff at home...for a hell of a lot cheaper.no bread was served to our table other than the bread from our brushetta. the brushetta wasnt great. the tomato mixture on top was good but the bread wasnt properly toasted so it got soggy and couldnt hold its shape. it kept falling apart when you picked it up. the desserts really brought this place back for me. i had their homemade creme brule and it was really excellent. on the menu it tells you which are made inhouse and i would highly recommend getting one of those. overall it was quite expensive for pretty basic italian food so it didnt stun me. im not opposed to going back but its not my first choice. my major reason for going back will be for convenience because it is so close to us."

    "review": "we wanted something sweet for dessert so after dinner we made our way to this place which boasts the best gelato in toronto. the gelato was good but certainly wasnt the best ive had. it was much more akin to ice cream and the flavour selection wasnt huge. that said they have some interesting flavours. i personally tried twix and birthday cake and they were both very good. the more traditional flavour i tried creme caramel was a little boring and lacked flavour. my husband had the strawberry skor and chocolate. all fine none blew me away.oh well no biggie.so since this place is about the cupcakes you may be interested in the cupcakes...well the taste was overall good but it was a very oily cupcake. the icing especially. the cake was moist which is good...except it was so moist the cake was just falling apart everywhere so whats the final synopsis. this place isnt bad. it has some delicious options. but nothing is perfect and in fact there are a number of flaws which prevent me from giving it a better score. well see how i feel if its a boiling hot summer day...i may be singing a different tune"

    "review": "we booked a reservation at smith for summerlicious. one of the major problems was finding it though. almost every one in our party either didnt see it initially its sort of nondescript looking or werent sure which door staircase was the proper one to get inside. once inside though its an eclectic blend of vintage meets whitewashed industrial. if you didnt know that was a style neither did i but it totally works. there was a great blend of music in the background...it was a mix probably an employee just made it but it was great mood music. i want that mix cd my brother had called several weeks ago to make a reservation and somehow they didnt have it. apparently its an answering service for reservations and they say they call you back if they cant accommodate you. he never received a call back so the assumption was that the reservation was alright. unfortunately as i said there was no reservation. the staff apologized profusely though and luckily there was space and they set up a table for us right away. we ordered from the drink menu and i will say that they drinks are very expensive. the wine is what you would expect and the mixed drink at least the one i had the smith lemonade was fantastic but it was also  which is steep even for toronto bar standards. as i said we ordered from the summerlicious menu. i have heard many comments online that people are feeling disillusioned with summerlicious because so many restaurants give you the cheapest options and its not worth the cost. this was not the case with smith at all. there were several great options to choose from and the food was excellent. i had the curried carrot soup which was spicy but great. every one else in my party also enjoyed their various appetizers. my main course was a georgian bay whitefish which was done perfectly just crispy enough on the outside and flaky on the inside. the pork chops were also raved about. there was also a risotto which two of the three people who ordered it really enjoyed. you cant take that last guy brother again too seriously since hes a very picky eater. the desserts were all good however the fudge ice cream is really just chocolate ice cream nothing special. the lemon curd tasted like lemon pie filling and was delicious and the bread pudding was heavenly seriously it was so good. i think everyone left feeling really satisfied. it did take a long time to get the food. this wasnt a problem for us since we were there to converse and i understand that great food may take some time but if you are really hungry or looking for a quicker meal this isnt the right choice.basically it lost of star because of the lost reservation and lack of visibility from the street. also we werent thrilled with the washrooms. besides the fact that they are coed which is a little weird there is one large sink and a foot peddle to operate it. since only one person can step on it at a time you have to wait for that person to finish before you can wash your hands which starts to cause a bit of a backup if more than two people are in the washroom. also the hand dryers were weak not working. that said i wouldnt let a slightly annoying bathroom stop me from coming here this is a nice little place"

    "review": "poor hero burger is getting a lot of flack from people. ive never had anything but good experiences here. i think the burgers here are heads and tails above many other gourmet burger places mainly because the diversity of toppings. i like the fries here but theyre nothing special. same with the poutine same with the onion rings ive tried em all. but those burgers are good no word of a liei think the prices are pretty standard for these types of burger places and service has always been fine for me.they have a great coke machine...which i know sounds super weird but you choose your drink...and then can choose the flavour. for example...if i want fanta i select that and can then choose any number of fanta flavours. i always go with a diet coke...where else does that even exist in canada ill tell you actually. you can get that at licks but they get really confused when you ask for diet coke instead of regular...they make it themselves. criticisms of the small location are valid. this place is very small and cramped. not nice to eat in...or even to wait. but it is what it is. they have a mounted flat screen for people to watch and theyve done what can can in a super small space."

    "review": "i wish there was the option to give half stars because if there was i would give lemon bistro  . overall our experience was fine and i would probably try it again but i wont be rushing back. we called to make reservations. i asked for  or  and was told that  would be better. assuming that meant  was a busy time we went to the area and were prepared to wander around for a bit...but the restaurant was almost empty so we went in and were seated promptly. our waitress was very friendly and took our orders. i had the mussels and my husband had the salad. both were good although the mussels were quite spicy something i wish was specified before ordering. my husband ordered the pork and i had the pasta. his dish was prepared very well and the meat very tender and nice. my pasta however was very bland. the pasta noodles were overcooked and fell apart easily making it hard to twist in my fork. the limited sauce had little flavour. the chicken and mushrooms in the pasta were the best part but it wasnt enough to make me consider this a good dish. more like something i would make for myself at home and be only mildly satisfied. when the server gave us our bill she took away my husbands beer that he was not finished with. we didnt notice until it was too late. all this said i saw other dishes that looked pretty amazing my husbands food was much better than mine and despite the beer stealing the waitress was very nice. the atmosphere made for a nice date spot. its not cheap though coming to  for the two apps two drinks and two mains. so i was hoping for a little better. i hope if i try this place again it will please me a little more."

    "review": "not a horrible place but certainly not good.i landed in one concourse of the a terminal and flew out of another within the same terminal.  i walked through the first and saw several food options which gave me hope for my options near my departure gate.  unfortunately after my long walk to the other concourse i found there to be very limited options.  this i cannot understand.  both concourses had a similar number of gates yet one was loaded with options and the other completely lacked them.  of course by the time i walked to my departure gate i did not have time to wander back to the other concourse so i settled for a lesser option near my gate.just hope you do not have to change terminals or rent a car.  either requires a bus trip.  that is a big pet peeve of mine.  at least you do not have to take a train like in atlanta or denver.the last issue i will cover in this review is the fact that southwest and us airways hold most of the spots at this airport.  that is enough reason not to fly here."

    "review": "it was a busy night so they told us about a  minute wait. ok no problem we just went over to the bar for some drinks to burn some time. the problem though was the fact that we walked by several open tables that suited our group size. we just wrote it off to maybe being down a server. that was until they sat us forty minutes later at one of those very tables that was open when we walked in.the bartender was good. he moved quickly and was on top of things. he also worked with our server to transfer our tab to our table. a simple thing that many places will not do so it was appreciated.our server at the table was also good. he came by often and was friendly. his visits got a little too space out toward the end but overall it was good.there are plenty of televisions to catch the game or many games for that matter. there is a large bar area and a lot of regular seating as well. they had a live band in later in the evening. i am normally ok with this at a bar but it confuses me at a sports bar. especially with so many great pm games on. also for whatever reason it was very warm inside. it was slightly crowded at times but not enough to justify the excessive heat.the food was ok. i ordered  boneless wings in the flaming parmesan sauce. the sauce had decent flavor but was certainly not flaming. the wings were large but slightly over cooked. not burnt but overly crisp.i also ordered the steel town spuds with tater tots. you get a good sized portion. the tots come topped with ranch dressing bacon scallions and melted cheese. the flavor was ok. they brought out some buffalo sauce to dip it in and that made it much better."

    "review": "dear macayos i would like to thank you for renewing my hatred for your bland artery busting meximerican food. i hadnt experienced your brand of deep fried crap since i came of majority and stopped dined out with the family at restaurants that specialized in satisfying even the blandest of palettes. i must say you continue to exceed my wildest expectations in that respect i had to continue looking down at my plate just to make sure the  calories i was consuming were more than just a mirage of mexican food.i will admit that i have a long standing simmering hatred for you macayos. so maybe this biases my opinion a bit. i cant in my right mind fathom why i thought you deserved a second chance last night. i think its testament to the fact that sometimes i make super stupid decisions on an empty stomach especially when im hungry enough to eat the ass end out of week dead burro. i suppose i was expecting something a bit more appetizing than that stretch of hyperbole. how wrong i was.your patio was the highlight of the evening. its backed up against a lake and there was a duck that watched me eat. he had a shiny green head. it was nice. i made him my zen when all i wanted to do was lash out in frustration over the meal. if i could offer a suggestion to benefit both the duck and myself perhaps you could pipe some music out onto the patio because listening to suzie and sally suburb bitch about their waistlines while committing refried sin was pretty grating.the food however far outshone those cackling soccer moms in terms of annoyance. i dont know who you think you are macayos but charging  bucks an entree at your establishment just about gave me a heart attack long before the lard had a chance to bully up on my arteries. maybe its because i think you have the street value of a gum job from a run down whore but i have to say that those prices were shocking. i could travel the valley over and find better mexican food for much cheaper. for that price i expect outstanding quality and taste or at least a hip see and be seen environment. all you have is a duck working in your favor. i do have a serious question for you though whats with smothering your entrees in cream cheese and trying to pass it off as baja sauce it was the same jalapeno spread i get on my bagel in the morning but with even less heat and flavor. i suggest renaming it manhattan sauce in honor of the bagel and schmear capital of the nation and i think it would be a touching homage to the pace picante new york city commercials. i also cant understand why the majority of your entrees offer either rice or beans but few have these in conjunction. those are universal standards at a mexican food joint and the ultimate test of quality since theyre comparable the valley over. do they bring you shame is that why you dont want to offer them both or are you just a cheap nickel and diming motherfucker macayos im more apt to believe the latter because you charged me two bucks for guacamole without informing me that it cost extra. then you delivered a pile of gelatinous green goop of questionable origin that had absolutely zero flavor. by this point in the meal i really shouldnt have been surprised at how bland everything was because i was on to your ploy of substituting flavor for gobs of cream cheese and a heavy hand with the salt shaker. but despite stiff competition from the bland pico de gallo and the puzzling baja  sauce it was the shitamole took the grad prize of suckdom for the evening. i have never tasted weaker guac. you must have used some terrible avocados and whipped them with corn syrup or some other foodlike filler. there wasnt a zing of cilantro or lemon juice no hint of serrano spiciness not even the tang of some onion although i did see a couple soggy tomatoes bits added for color. i dont think i will ever be coming back macayos. its not you its... i cant lie even to spare your feelings. its you. its all you. im breaking up in a public setting because im scared that youll key my car while by back is turned or at the least smother it in cream cheese. i know youre into that freaky shit.wishing you deep fried broken dreamserica"

    "review": "i really dig a good ole mom and pop greasy spoon diner.unfortunately with the corporate skullduggery muscling out the competition and brainwashing america to embrace the familiar mediocrity of preformed seasoned sawdust theyre few and far between. i mean if i want a microwaved meal the same  states over id go to applechilidennybees. if i want some down home from scratch mama couldnt have made it better cookin ill go to cindys. being a small business the decor is a little hokey. theyre not spending money on some razzledazzle flash and awe marketing flare. they have ads embedded into the varnish of their table tops people theyre selling dining space for revenue just so they can keep their entrees cheap as sin we sat in a room that was a shrine to john wayne big enough to accomodate our  person group. there were no less than ten pictures of the duke. that includes four duplicates of that wacky picture where the scale of his hat is off and it cuts into his head about an inch. and to top it all off there was a mirror running the length of the other side of the room ensuring that double the duke stared down at us as we ate. weird.but what this little place lacks in ambiance it makes up for in food. i had a tuna melt on rye that was to die for. anyone who knows me can vouch for the fact that i believe the tuna melt to be a sandwich of the gods. fuck ambrosia. they were eating warm albacore over buttery crisp bread smothered in cheddar cheese and pan fried to perfection. and the fries were sprinkled with some kind of magic pixie dust that endowed them with the ability to make me profusely salivate.everyone at the table ordered something different from the hot roast beef dinner to the fried fish caesar salad to the pork fritter sandwich and it was agreed that all entrees were wicked fricken good. and breakfast is served all day long. super scoreso go pay homage to john wayne and he shall reward you with some good eats"

    "review": "i suppose i should write a review here since my little noodleoo is currently serving as their spokes dog in the photos. we both love scooby dos. they treat my little buttfaced dog like a prince and are receptive to correcting anything about the cut that i perceive as being weird. like that funny poofy pompadour. mohawk it out yo. done. in like five seconds my little man was looking fabulous and bad ass. not something easily accomplished with a prancing pup that literally chases butterflies through tall grasses. he ended up looking like a little lamb as the cut grew out too. so adorable.the shampoo they use here is also amazing. noodles usually smells like tacos a combination of beef stank and corn chips but after getting back from the dos he smelled like christmas morning sugar and spice and everything nice instead of frogs and snails and puppy dog tails. hes got some gender identity issues to deal with. the pricing is also cheaper than some of the big name conglomerates out there. im talking to you petsmart ive taken my other pup to smelly dog before but unless i need dog sitting play time after the cut ill go with scoobys. they genuinely seem to like my little noodle monster."

    "review": "love love love a taste of the caribbean the braised oxtails are heavenly succulent and fall off the bone tender. they had me audibly moaning with delight the entire meal. the plantains and braised cabbage on the side were perfect sides and the rice with pigeon peas was perfect for sopping up all that oxtail sauce. the jerk chicken was also fantastic but since i was so busy hoarding my oxtails i didnt get to try much of it. the jerk was smoky spicy and highlighted the chicken instead of overpowering it. same sides so at least we didnt have to fight over those. make sure to try the hibiscus flower drink sorrel with cloves floating in it. it accompanies the earthy spicy flavor palate of the meat well and is very similar to the jicama offered up at mexican joints.the atmosphere of this place is wonderfully warm and inviting. the eclectic and bold paint decorating the walls is very reminiscent of the caribbean and the fauxrattan chairs help with the vibe too. theres also a couch against one side of the restaurant that is kind of out of place but who am i to judge decor nothing in my house matches. in that respect its kind of like being invited over to a friends house for dinner and having her mom whoop up some of the most amazing ethnic food you never get at your kraft mac n cheese house. its clearly a family owned joint with all ages bumming around the kitchen. kiddos bring out water adolescents with hip hop ring tones take your order and the matriarchs keep them all in line. its energetic and engaging and utterly delicious. next time i need leave room for the cassava or coconut cake much harder to do than you may think. trust me.oh they also have some interesting breakfast options like smoked fish and such. dont worry they also have regular old eggs on the menu. check it out one morning for something outside of the norm"

    "review": "i just dont think im much of a brewery gal. granted the beer here blows four peaks out of the water but id much rather have a nice cocktail than chew though a specialty brew. but if beer is your poison of choice theyve got just about everything. the happy hour is kind of weak here though with like a buck off all drafts. thoroughly meh.you can peruse the coolers and grab a cold one or choose from  drafts they have on the menu. no bud light here though. sorry frat chumps. they used to have a ton of wine here as well like ages ago but it has since been narrowed down to just four choices none of which were calling my name this last go round. their orange blossom wheat beer was a bit like drinking an orange creamsicle in beer form. almost like a cider with floral notes a light finish and a super creamy mouthfeel. oh yeah bitches. i just went there. the perfect beer for the novice drinker to enjoy. their ipa was also pretty decent but was more bitter than i care for although it stayed far away from feeling like i was drinking a bottle of grassy perfume. solid.i thought they had deals on happy hour food again like a buck off but last time i went it was no dice. at least the foods reasonably priced. tasty rueben craptastic hummus crispy quesadilla. the acoustics in this place are kind of shitty so go on an off time when it wont be packed or run the risk of smiling and nodding amicably while hearing every other snippet of convo. the high top tables are also really uncomfortable for shorties like me to sit at but cest la vie. my biggest peeve about this place is the gigando assy television against the wall. for a place this small a big ass mofo tv is just  not the way to go."

    "review": "caffe boa is a hidden gem on mill avenue for both eating drinking and relaxing with friends. its a little bit on the pricey side though so take advantage of the happy hour and halfpriced sangria sundays.it used to be a tiny homey little cafe next to long wongs at th street and mill and has since been converted into a spacious classy winery and italian bistro at th street and mill.happy hour specials are only extended to the bar area which is tiny in comparison to the rest of the area. theres the traditional happy hour from  to  and a reverse happy hour that begins after  pm. check which days this is available though because im not sure its daily. draft beers like guiness and harp are two bucks wine by the glass is half off  to  bucks after the discount as are their fancy pants cocktails generally  bucksthe espresso martini is decadentand all appetizers aside from the huge cheese plate are half priced. one wonky thing about the tab for happy hour is that they take the discount off at the end so just keep a running tab in your head of how much you owe if youre with a group to make things go a little smoother.im in lust with the shrimp adriatico which is an appetizer that has five big tiger shrimp swimming in garlic tomato sauce thats served with a loaf of bread for dipping. its filling enough to serve as an entire meal or to share among friends.on sundays pitchers of sangria are half priced  instead of  and are a refreshing way to relax with a group of friends in the afternoon. i prefer the white wine over the red because it compliments the freshly sliced apples and muddled citrus. make sure to ask them to go easy on the cinnamon though or you may end up with an overpowering flavor and chalky texture.dinner is always divine as well but a little bit on the pricey side. the meals are huge though so youre pretty much guaranteed leftovers or you can split an entre with another person for an extra  buck charge. the voodoo penne is a delicious cajun flavored dish lucas meatballs are savory and filling and the pola pola is some awesome artichoke ravioli. everything is done well and i rarely encounter problems with the servers or bartenders.its a nice mellow break from the hubbub of mill avenue.updateive been a little peeved lately at the happy hour since its only extended to the bar and the bar is so damn tiny. now i understand that if i dont get there around  i have no chance of getting a seat. thats fine. but the damn chase employees get there around  before happy hour even starts wheres the logic in that and hog all the damn seats leaving me with nothing but shattered hope and an empty glass. you better shape up caffe boa or im docking a starupdateyouve been docked a star boa. you went and increased the prices of your entrees by three bucks at the very least. fuck you and your scrumtious mouth watering  dollar spaghetti and meatballs. theyre fucking meatballs boa plus your half price on glasses of wine less than  bucks is a pretty useless deal now. jeezy creezy.this isnt goodbye though. ill still chill with you on sundays for the sangria but i shall never indulge in the pola pola voodoo penne or your shitty willow bakery bread again. bastards."

    "review": "if you havent been here. go. now. stop reading this review ignore the fact that you just ate an hour ago and go nosh the shit out of some of the best damn chicken youll find in the valley. there are only two options at this place that are on par with some of the best carne asada or red chicken youll get from a carniceria. seeing how the only options are chicken or beef or both go wild its probably not the best place to bring a leaf eater. theyll be stuck munching on marinated onions since im pretty sure the tortillas and pinto beans have got a lovely amount of lard in them plus their senses will be assaulted by the delicious smell of succulent juicy grilled meat. that smell by the way can be detected throughout the strip mall this place is located in and without a fail gets me salivating whenever i walk by. everything is prepared lightening fast and you can eat in the place or get your food to go. the combos are dirt cheap and delicious at four bucks for a   beef or chicken and seven bucks for the combination of the two. each combo comes with two torillas pinto beans salsa and maninated onions. half and whole chickens or piles of beef are also available for extremely reasonable prices. they only take cash though so run over to the circle k at ash and university to the money machine if you find yourself with nothing but plastic. the . fee to use the atm will be totally worth it."

    "review": "i am a hummus fiend. i have made tabbouleh so delicious that the heavens parted and rained down tears of joy upon its consumption. i will cut a bitch over the last dollop of garlic dip. dont even get me started on baba ghanoush.so its almost a guarantee that i will like anything that draws upon a mediterranean flavor palate. med fresh is no exception.its technically turkish but i dont split hairs when it comes to mediterranean. the pitas are fresh and flavorful the tzatziki is kickin and the gyro meat beef and chicken are always moist and delicious. everything is prepared as you order it and you have a clear view of the goingson in the sunken kitchen. the staff can be a bit terse at times but theyre always professional and quick to disperse a busy lunch rush. the platters are priced well for the mound of food you receive and while i have had some tonsilscraping dry chicken on occasion the majority of the time the kababs and koftas are moist and tender. if you simply cant be pressed to make up your mind go with the mixed grill and get a bit of a variety. the pita sammich special  is the best bang for your buck on the menu. pita meat tomato lettuce weird pickles and secret sauce. served with tzatziki and their killer spicy red sauce. salad or fries on the side. .. oh yeah."

    "review": "ive been going to the roosevelt since just after it opened and im extremely pleased to see how its blossomed into such a lovely little bar with excellent patronage. my little boys all growed upi have one reason that is the indisputable unassailable golden rationale for why you should visit the roosevelt shark beer so important it deserves both capitalization and idolization.distilled from the finest aquatic varieties and banned in all fifty states its pale gold opaque frothiness will lull you into a happy state of drunkenness and sociability. the great white northern is by far the finest beer to ever pass these lips. ive had the wine on occasion but compared to the deliciosity that is shark beer my only recollection is that it doesnt suck.i regrettably havent had the full roosevelt experience as ive never spent any moolah on the food there. well mr. man did order the four dollar peanuts once and i tried them. yes. four dollars. for a pile of peanuts. weird thing is he thought they were worth every penny. granted they were huge warm and tasty but theyre fucking four dollar peanuts aside from that ive heard from a fair number of people that the food is delectable and worth the price but ive never been in the munching mood here. happy hour is undoubtedly the best time to visit this little bastion of class and comfort in downtown phoenix and every time i have been here at this hour the bar has been packed with well dressed and business casual folks. evenings are a bit more intimate with fewer people but youre pretty much guaranteed a seat somewhere or if you come with a group of friends thats my shout out to the lovely yelpers i met here recently there is ample space for your group to socialize.when you go check out the funky little door in the central room above the bathroom corridor and then tell me just where you think it leads or what theyre hiding up there. is it a portal to another dimension do they keep some red headed stepchild up there or is this where people who try to skip out on their tabs are detained the mystery brings my overactive imagination great joy. i also dig the naked lady checking out a passing train picture in the restroom which is like big enough to entertain company in.my one gripe is that they keep it cold as a meat locker in there and my little toesies need dethawing in the arizona heat after i exit the building. and this pithy reasons got nothing on the roosevelt. and the shark beer."

    "review": "you want a monster sandwich that will challenge the hunger of even the burliest man go order a dagwood from gandolfos deli. its roast beef turkey ham pastrami cheddar lettuce tomato onion pickles mayo spicy mustard salt and pepper as close to nirvana as im ever getting. in case you couldnt tell by the ingredients i was a little indecisive about what kind of sandwich i wanted so i just took the works.during lunch it can get a little hairy in gandolfos deli and im not talking about the number of people there which is many but the ratio of males to females which is very high me being the only customer lacking a y chromosome. there is a reason why this is so. these sandwiches are monstrous meat and cheese concoctions slathered in sauce and served big. i could easily make a phallic reference about all these men consuming massive hoagies but im going to take the high road this review.i was considering the hard salami smothered in sauce but i didnt know if it would be filling enough...okay. so the low road suits me better. i opted for the . meal deal to complement my dagwood which left me with a gigantic sandwich a quarter pound of potato salad and a regular iced tea with plenty left over for dinner that night. it was close to ten bucks after tax which is a little bit on the pricey side but at least i made two meals of it. the potato salad was decent but lacked salt like they didnt bother boiling the potatoes with this necessary ingredient. i love me some salt. get me a lick and ill take a cheese grater to it to season my meals. or make me a salt flavored ring pop for those mid day cravings. my blood pressure will curse you but ill be singing your praises. after adding this magic ingredient gandolfos potato salad got pretty good and they get extra credit for using red potatoes leaving the skin on and preparing it with vinaigrette and mayo instead of mustard. yumits pretty decent for a sandwich shop and the menu is intimidating in size and offerings. you could do much worse coughblimpiescough so give it a whirl if you find yourself in the area."

    "review": "hulas is vibrant and lovely its most def a modern take on retro tiki. and they have two dollar mimosas for weekend brunch yall thats all you need to know about brunch which is a good thing considering its pretty bland. we tried the island eggs benedict  with the kielbasa and the hulas hangover hash . the eggs benedict were done very well but nothing really sets this dish apart from one you could get anywhere else even with the atypical meat choices. it was the hawaiian pulled pork hash that was a total bummer on the plate. the hashbrowns were practically black in some places and mushy in others and the pulled pork was a mass of dry bland shredded meat. to top it off the eggs were done over hard with no runny yolk goodness. suck.probably will not return for brunch but mimosas and tacos may be in my future the tiki time happy hour also shows promise."

    "review": "to preface tomato jam. all day. everyday. thats seriously half the reason i go to postinoused to live near the arcadia one and got crazy on some  bruschetta and wine monday and tuesday nights. tried this location out about five times since its opening. food and wine are on point decor is beautiful. really nice to see the old asu art annex revitalized but the service is seriously spotty. ive had one good experience out of the five and the rest suffered from forgotten or wrong wine plank of bruschetta never arriving because the order wasnt placed messed up orders a  minute wait for a half empty restaurant. weird and really spotty service. but really enthusiastic weird and spotty service i feel like they just a couple seasoned veterans to bring the cute undergrad servers with zero experience up to speed."

    "review": "this place is the equivalent of salt lick thai. i could taste very little else over the heavy hand with the sodium in the kitchen. none of the mouth watering aromatics that normally characterize thai were detectable either. sorry basil lemongrass coconut milk and galanga. mixed vegetables consisted of bamboo shoots and green beans very adventurous and the bamboo shoots were undercooked and mega crunchy. hot apparently translates to a mild tingle on your tongue so dont go expecting to sate your scoville craving. and to top it all off the portions we received were meager for the prices. i might have caught them on a bad day but theres much better thai to be had in the valley. even though i live in arcadia i dont think theres any way im coming back."
