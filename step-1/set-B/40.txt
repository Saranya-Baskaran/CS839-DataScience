cute place on a side street - really only serving the locals around the Woodbine\/Danforth area.

bf ordered a <coffee/> here that he thought was pretty good. they seem to have <smoothies/> and fresh <juices/> as well. and nifty <rice bowls/>. 

will be back to try out the <juices/> and food.

seems to be a quiet place to chill for a couple of hours.
