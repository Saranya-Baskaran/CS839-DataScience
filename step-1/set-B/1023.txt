This place would've gotten that fifth star if their lunch menu had more on it that was vegetarian.  That being said, the <cremini mushroom/> and <egg/> dish I had was VERY good, and very filling.  It doesn't look like a lot of food, but it was more than enough for me.  I couldn't finish it.  The service here is also excellent.  The servers really take care of you.  I did not run out of water until the very last moment, after we paid the checks and were about to leave.  I had a hard time finding it, because it's easy to get lost in Caesar's Palace, but it's worth wandering around for.
