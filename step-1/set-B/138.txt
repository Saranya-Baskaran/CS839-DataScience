Went here with my sister and her boyfriend for some drinks. We were hungry and ordered a few appetizers to share. Drinks were fine (my mix drink was on the VERY small side), but the food was really good. The <perogies/> and "<chips/>" and <dip/> were excellent. The service was good and the atmosphere was nice, for such a small place. Bathrooms were also nice, clean, etc. Only problem is that some of the tables are SO small, it's really hard to use them. We were at a very small one and even though we fit around it alright, a guy walking by knocked a beer over with his coat and it dumped all down me. I mean ALL over me. It's not the bar's fault the guy knocked the glass, but if the table was a bit bigger we would have had more room to put the glass further in, so it wouldn't have gotten knocked in the first place. The fact is, if you're going to serve food people need a place to put it. A few slightly bigger tables would go a long way.
