When I was a kid I would eat a pile of plain <noodles/> with <butter/> on them while the rest of my family mowed down on real Italian food. I think it had more to do with the fact that <spaghetti/> given to a kiddo is more likely to end up on them than in them, and <tomato sauce/> hurts when it ends up in your eye. But in twenty-odd years my palate has matured past the realm of bland <noodles/> and into the realm of big girl flavors. I think that's why I was so disappointed by Giuseppe's.
