The only downside to this place, I think, is that it needs more seating.  I've heard that this one has more than the other Vegas location, but my friend and I had to wait a few minutes to get a place to sit for two.  Other than that... the service was great.  I'm a vegetarian, and they let me swap out the meat that was on the menu for a side dish, so I was able to make my meal even more healthy.  It's a fun place, because they have two sides to the menu: "Healthy" and "Happy" (i.e., not healthy, haha!).  So, if you're friends with a super healthy person, or a super unhealthy person, there's something for either one!  I would say it's more on the expensive side for a <naan/>, just for a small meal; but I enjoyed what I had, and definitely plan on coming back.
