I was tempted to give this place two stars, but I'll explain why.  First and foremost, the view from their balcony is absolutely the best thing about this place.  It offers one of the best views of the Strip you can possibly get.  My date and I got free tickets to go up and enjoy the place.  It has a really cool vibe to it, as well.

But, unfortunately, my date was Completely ignored by the bartender when he went to get a drink, <whisky/> and <wine/>.  He stood there 20 minutes(!!), with a $100 bill in his hand, all the while trying to get the guy's attention and watching others get served.  Finally my date told him he was the worst bartender he'd ever met.  Best part: the guy didn't even react.  Wow, Foundation Room.  Way to not impress.  Bottom line: go for the view.  If you're lucky you might not be ignored by the bartender.
