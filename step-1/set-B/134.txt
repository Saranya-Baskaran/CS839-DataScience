Our friends got the groupon for four people and took us along. I'm very pleased we went! Having never had Ethiopian food before, we were curious, but wary. The deal really helped us dive in. It included two appetizers, four main courses and two desserts. We started with two appetizers, one I wasn't a huge fan of (a "<salad/>" with a strong vinegar taste and <jalapenos/>, which I found too strong, although other people in my group really liked it). The other appetizer was similar to an Indian <samosa/> (similar name too, but I can't remember exactly what it was called). They were stuff with <lentils/> and had a flaky shell. They were DELICIOUS. BUT, their appetizers were only made for three people, so there were only three of them! Seems silly when you offer a four person deal. 

It would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon, so I'm not sure I would make this a regularly destination, but as I said, the <coffee/> was fantastic and it's a fun thing to try, especially with friends. Make sure they're good ones, that you don't mind getting messy in front of!
