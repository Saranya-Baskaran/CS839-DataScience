Went here after dinner across the street at <Lemon/> Bistro. Was excited to see a <Nutella/> <Latte/> on the menu, which I ordered and which was good, but lacking much in the way, other than a slight <hazelnut/> flavour. 

Ordered <pistachio/> and it was great. Service was lovely. Nice, cozy little place. 

Those added suggestions would make this place over the top is all. Still, a solid place, I would recommend.
