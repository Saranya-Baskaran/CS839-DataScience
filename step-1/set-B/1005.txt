Woah!

Really really delicious place! It's a treat to watch them make the <hand pulled noodles/>. Try the <shallot pancake/> as a starter - it's crispy and yummy!

The food is 5 stars but the restaurant itself is quite bare and the service is no-frills. 

Warning to vegetarians: the <noodle soup/> is with a <chicken broth/>.
