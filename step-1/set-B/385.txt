I've been here twice now, and there are definitely dishes here that are better than others.  I'm vegetarian, so I'm limited to begin with; and I'm kind of a health nut, so that limits me further.  If you're at all like me, avoid the <egg/> dishes with the <hash browns/>; in my opinion, there wasn't enough taste to compensate for how much <oil/>, <butter/>, fat was clearly used.  On the other hand, the <waffles/> with <fruit/> are SO GOOD.  I haven't tried the <pancakes/>, but plan to next time I'm there.  I haven't tried any of the dinner options (not many options there for vegetarians), but if you like having breakfast anytime, this place is open 24\/7 and serves breakfast items all day and all night.  It's a handy place to come if it's midnight and you're starving!

The cool atmosphere is why you come here, essentially.  The food by itself isn't mind-blowing, but it has a cool vibe - and conveniently is open 24\/7, for your round-the-clock eating needs.  I live here in Vegas, so I'm sure I'll be back many times in the future.
