The word that most aptly describes the Sneaker's experience:

Eww.

This exclamation should be accompanied by a scrunched up nose, sneer or depressed sigh depending on the intonation.

Does the smell of open sewage wafting from the bathrooms entice your tastebuds? Eww! *scrunchy nose*

Do shriveled <potato skins/>, overcooked fried <zucchini sticks/>, or soggy <hot wings/> float your boat? Eww. *disdainful sneer*
