a few years ago, this used to be the place to be for bunch. I was really excited to take my boyfriend here to experience one of the "must visit places in MTL". Boy were we disappointed!

We had ordered the <eggspectation omelette/> and <eggs benedict/>. The <omelette/> was bland, overcooked. The <eggs benedict/> were ok, but I've had better. The portion size has come down.

Overall, food and service has gone downhill and not worth my time anymore.
