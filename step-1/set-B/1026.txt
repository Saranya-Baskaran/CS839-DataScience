Amazing <food/>, and great music provided by some friends of mine!  I've been here a couple of times, but finally had the chance to eat this time around.  I had their <eggplant parmesan/> and <spaghetti/> combination plate - yum, yum, yum!  The prices are a little on the high side for my usual, but it's totally worth it.  Romantic, intimate venue with delicious <food/> - and fantastic service!  Will definitely return here!
