There isn't much here for vegetarians, but I had their <portabello mushroom sandwich/> and <sweet potato fries/> - both of which I enjoyed.  The waitress was attentive and courteous, and my friend and I were well taken care of.  A lot of reviews talk about breakfast and brunch...  We went for dinner, but I might return at some point to try other meals.
