Hidden in the east end of the Danforth, who knew there would be a little Ethiopian community?

The decor is definitely interesting. Although, the outside has lots of lights as decoration, the inside is kind of dark. The red lighting and orange menu makes it hard to read.

The food is not bad. Although they tell you that the <vegetarian platter/> is only for one person - this platter is definitely made for sharing!
