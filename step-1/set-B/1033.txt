I've never had any food here, but the drinks are great and the jazz is awesome!  I've seen two of the lovely ladies who perform here, and have met most of the musicians - as I am one myself - making great musical vibes from 10 pm until 2 am.  The lounge itself has an intimate ambiance, which is perfect for jazz.  Take your date here, your best friend, or your family - it's a great place for any and all.
