I got a regular <cheeseburger/> without the <salad/> option because they actually ran out of <salad/>...The place was kind of pricey too because the portion sizes are a lot smaller than you think. I thought it tasted great, but for the price, I won't go out of my way. The service was not so great because the cashier was a little rude explaining to me that there was no <salad/> left. I asked if there were any other options for greens and she not so nicely told me no.
