I wish I could give this a 3.5 rating.  I'd never even heard of <poutine/> until a friend recommended this place.  We ended up going together and sharing one, since I had eaten not long before arriving.  Let me preface this review with this: I'm a SUPER healthy eater, as a rule - so this is not something I'd eat all the time (hence the low-ish rating).  But I did enjoy it; both of us did.  It doesn't say so on the menu, but you can change up the <sauces/> on whatever <poutine/> you get, so be sure to try the <mushroom sauce/>.  That was my favorite part about it!  If you're in Vegas and you're looking for some poutine, this is the place to go.  And, as a fun touristy item of note, you'll be parked right next to the world famous Pawn Stars pawn shop.
