We ordered an extra <pita/> for the <hummus/>, which was overkill and we didn't even end up touching it because the "small <hummus/>" ended up being freakin' huge and the <pita/> was sized to match. It was smooth and creamy, and garnished with two of my favorite <vegetables/> (or whatever an <olive/> technically is), <cucumbers/> and <kalamata olives/>! My one gripe about the entire meal was that my <chicken/> was overly dry and a smidgen bland, but the hummus more than made up for that lack in flavor. The side <Greek salad/> that came with my wrap was also stupendous, with a hefty amount of <feta/> and a delicious, light <vinaigrette/> to counter that richness.
