My Valentine's Day date took me here for dinner.  First of all, we were late for our reservation because my date had a corporate gig run late, and they were extremely accommodating and friendly about it!  When we arrived, I got my fresh, beautiful, red rose (all ladies who come here receive one), and were seated immediately.  We had a few different servers attend to us - one for <wines/>, one for our <salad/>, and another for the rest of our needs.  I was blown away by the romantic setting, incredible service, and the impressive food!  As a vegetarian, your options are limited here, but never fear!  I had the vegetarian entree, which changes by the day.  When we went, it was <mushroom ravioli/>, and oh wow.  It was SO good!  They were out of the <raspberry cheesecake/> when we got to dessert, so we chose the <berry/> <tart/> instead... I'm glad they were out of the <cheesecake/>, because we wouldn't have gotten to try it otherwise!  (There are no words for how good it was.)  Everything about this experience was extremely positive.  It is on the tad pricey side, but if you want to really give a woman a romantic evening, this is the perfect place to go (unless you're vegan or a raw foodie, that is...).  Thank you Hugo's Cellar, for a lovely evening!
