So far it's been 1.5 hours and the <sushi/> still has not arrived. I ordered <chicken bulgogi/> and they bring out <beef/> without telling me they ran out of <chicken/> and would only comp 10% on food I didn't want.  It is very loud and drunk people screaming and cursing while kids sit near causing people to leave.  The table next to us has been waiting even longer then us and they are still waiting.  I do not recommend this place as far as service goes.  I couldn't tell you the quality of the food because it never made it out.
