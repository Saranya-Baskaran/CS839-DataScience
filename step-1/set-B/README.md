# Introduction

We are identifying food entities the Yelp reviews dataset. 

> Food entity is defined as any noun that can occur in a food menu excluding generic terms like food, water, lunch etc.

Each file in the [set-B directory](https://github.com/yogeshchellappa/CS839-DataScience/tree/master/step-1/set-B) is text file containing a review with annotations for food entities.

Each food entity is annotated in its entirety using xml tags `< />`
