I'd give this place a 3.5 if I could.  The <pancake/> I had was huge, filled with <blueberries/>, and was delicious.  I avoid sugar, so I just had <fruit/> on the side that I could put on top, instead of <syrup/>.  The real highlight of the food was the fresh-squeezed <tangerine juice/> that I had.  Holy crapola, it was SO good!!  Our server was nice and attentive, and the place was clean overall.  Really enjoyed looking at all the celeb memorabilia all over the walls, as well.  I'm super healthy and a vegetarian, so honestly there's not much here for me, but I definitely consider this an ok place to come for breakfast.
