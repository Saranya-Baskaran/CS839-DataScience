I first heard about Freshii when it became all the rage in Toronto 3 years ago. 

I tried the <Buddha bowl/> and it tasted great - but wasn't anything special. It's great for a fast food chain, fresh (haha) and tastes pretty good. It's not the sort of place you'd go out of your way to go to but hey if it's on the way why not?
