Solid <soup/> place...has an ever-so-slightly sketchy vibe to it...you order and the woman disappears into the back...usually closes the sliding window so you can't see back there and then eventually emerges. Also seems to sell a selection of Jamaican movies in DVD from a glass case...sort of random.

Generous with the <veggies/>, less so with <dumplings/>, but all the <soups/> have great flavour and are decently sized for the price. I wish they would offer some <bread/> or <crackers/>...would be a nice, easy add-on. But this place is what it is and doesn't bother with the bells and whistles. Really deserves a 3.5 stars. The red bean is my fav by far.
