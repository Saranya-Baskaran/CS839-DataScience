Barro's is what Digiorno wishes it could be with that rising crust crap. I swear, if I could eat Barro's every day without my arteries protesting, I would. (And could, because it's cheaper compared to other pricier options like Venezia's and Spinato's.)

The <cheese/> is high quality, salty, melty, and they don't skimp. The crust is chewy and thick and awesome with some of those rad mega crust bubbles near the edge. The toppings are always high quality and generous. The <wings/> are thick and juicy, deep fried to a crisp and then smothered in the perfect amount of <sauce/>. And they deliver to me three miles away, which makes me super happy.
