I appreciated the vegan options here - had the <seared polenta/>, and enjoyed it - and overall had a good experience when I came for happy hour with a group of people for a birthday celebration.  I only have two small complaints: the <food/> and <drinks/> took a really long time to get to us, and the frightened doggy running around the place (I agree with another reviewer - not sure this is legal in a restaurant).  But, the guy who waited on us was one of the chefs, and was not only a great guy, but remembered the name of every person in our 15+ person group, and there were no problems keeping track of our various tabs.  It'll be interesting to see what happens with this place.  It's near the office where my work is based, so I'll likely be back with coworkers at some point.
