As my first foray into Las Vegas pizza, I was extremely happy with this place!  Our waiter was extremely diligent and courteous (even got basketball scores for my dad, who was curious about how his favorite team was doing), and checked on us frequently.  We got a <salad/> with <pear/>, <tomato/>, and <mixed greens/> - very very delicious - and a large <pizza/> with <onion/> and <green pepper/> - ALSO very delicious!  Brick oven style <pizza/> is my favorite - I just love that certain taste.  And that's what you'll get here.  The cool thing is, the kitchen is in an open alcove, so you can actually see the oven, and the workers making your <pizza/>.  This place just has a really nice atmosphere.  Even though there's a bar and TVs, my dad and I didn't have to shout to hear each other.  I look forward to bringing friends here when I return.
