I'd heard such rave reviews before I came here, so I had some expectations built up.  For my taste, the serving sizes were a little small.  I had the <veggie burger/>, which was good, but wasn't mind-blowing.  I like the location, so I'll likely be back with friends, and I'll try other foods, but as of this moment, it's not my favorite vegetarian-friendly place in town.
