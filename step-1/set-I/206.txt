I've eaten here several times as I work in the area.

As usual for a food court area in a casino it's always very loud here. The line is usually very long as well.

I've never tried Popeyes prior to this place opening and can say after several visits that if this is typical of all <Popeyes Chicken/> I'm not a big fan of their food.
