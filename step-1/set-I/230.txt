Not a bad airport. The concourses desperately need an overhaul.  The look and feel is dated.  The central terminal area is in better condition though.

The airport does have a good number of food options for a mid size airport.  That is a big deal.  We all want options.

The other issue is one that it is hard to hold against the airport, it is a US Airways hub.  I cannot not blame Charlotte for that.  You take what you can get, even if it is US Airways.
