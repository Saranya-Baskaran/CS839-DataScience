This place is right across the street from my place so I've been here a few times. It shares a building with a <Subway sandwich/> shop so you can get yourself a fairly healthy <sandwich/> and ruin the meal by topping it off with a few <donuts/>. LOL


Other than that it's Winchell's my favorite <donuts/>. You'd have to really annoy me to make me not like Winchell's.

It's also open 24 hours a day. So when that sweet tooth strikes I don't have far to go.
