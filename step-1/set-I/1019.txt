Not a gourmet dining experience, but the service is great, and the food is delicious!  I had their <fruit pancakes/>, and they are soooo good.  I'm a healthy eater, so I didn't use the <butter/> or <syrup/> I was given.  They were perfect as they were, with tons of <fruit/> baked into them.  I've also come here and gotten dinner, as well.  Yummy <veggie burger/>!  I'll definitely be back again.
