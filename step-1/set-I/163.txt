Our waitress was very friendly and took our orders. I had the <mussels/> and my husband had the salad. Both were good, although the <mussels/> were quite spicy, something I wish was specified before ordering. 

My husband ordered the <pork/> and I had the <pasta/>. His dish was prepared very well and the meat very tender and nice. My <pasta/> however was very bland. the <pasta noodles/> were overcooked and fell apart easily, making it hard to twist in my fork. The limited <sauce/> had little flavour. The <chicken/> and <mushrooms/> in the <pasta/> were the best part, but it wasn't enough to make me consider this a "good" dish. More like something I would make for myself at home and be only mildly satisfied.
