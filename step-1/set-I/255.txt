You are not going to find much better views of the Las Vegas strip.  We sat at a table on the bar side of Mix.  That is where the best views are.

The bar has a few great <appetizer/> options.  It helped tide us over until our dinner much later that night.  The <mac and cheese/> was tasty, as were the <potatoes/>.

They also have a nice drink menu.
