Came here for <dim sum/> - it's one of those mark on a sheet to order.

The <dim sum/> here is pretty decent and tasty. It can get a bit pricey, but other reviews say if you come early (before 10:45am) you can get all sizes for the same price. 

Definitely order from the dessert section - they have some pretty unique and tasty options.
