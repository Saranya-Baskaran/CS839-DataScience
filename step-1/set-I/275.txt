The fact that this place is BYOB makes my heart smile. I love sharing a couple bottles of good wine or champagne among friends over dinner, and the fact that I don't have to pay a restaurant mark-up is ideal. He's also cool with you brining in some <orange/> or <cranberry juice/> for  DIY <mimosas/> in the morning. There's a $10 corking fee, but considering the fact that a glass of <wine/> is often more expensive than that, it's a screaming deal.
