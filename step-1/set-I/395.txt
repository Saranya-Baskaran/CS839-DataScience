Wow, I love this place!  I've been to one of the other Sambalatte locations in town, but I like this one better.  The upstairs with recliners and little <tea/> tables just adds to the cozy appeal.  Their <teas/> (I've now tried three different kinds) are all great, and my friend - who had the <hot chocolate/> - said that was delicious, as well.   Their Christmas decorations that were up when I went were also adorable and pretty.  Look forward to coming back here, and maybe exploring Boca Park a little more, as well...
