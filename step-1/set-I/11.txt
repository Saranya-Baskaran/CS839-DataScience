This is currently my parents new favourite restaurant. 

We come here in the morning for <dim sum/>. They are not the cart pushing type of <dim sum/>, it is order off of the sheet. <Dim sum/> is not bad and not expensive either.

We also frequent the dinner scene. Their set dinner menu is not bad. We typically order a 6 dish menu and it's big enough to feed a family of 9 with leftovers. 

Overall, food is pretty tasty!
