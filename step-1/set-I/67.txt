Decided to give this place a try since I was in the neighbourhood! Love that there was no line up at all. However, coming here at 5pm on Saturday afternoon and only original flavour was left!

They have three flavours to choose from: Original, <Chocolate/> and <Coffee/>.

My nephews loved it and thought it was better than Uncle Tetsu (which I have not yet tried).
