Stopped in here recently for lunch. I ordered a <chicken sandwich/> combo to go.

I also had to ask for the <fries/> that went with my combo. I got them, but only after a heavy sigh from one of the two at the counter. You would have thought I'd asked him to come outside and change my tire rather then just asking them for a bag of <fries/>.

The food was mediocre, probably a three. But the lack of enthusiastic service definitely drops it to a two.
