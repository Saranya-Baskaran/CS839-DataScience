I'm not a fan. The food is overpriced for the quality. The <chicken shawarma/> came with one very small container of <garlic sauce/>, which was not nearly enough to cover the dry <chicken/>. The meals don't come with <hummus/> or any other <sauces/>. The quantity of <rice/> was substantial but maybe just to make it look like more <food/> than you actually receive. The <falafels/> were also extremely dry and bland. I won't be returning.
