Wowwww.  Okay, so - five star rating, not easy to get from me.  But this place HAS to be on my top ten favorite restaurants in Vegas as of this moment.  Their <hummus/> is out of this WORLD.  I actually liked it more than the <wrap/> that I had (which was definitely tasty!).  Seriously.  You have to go and try it for yourself.  It's a hidden gem.  You can easily miss it, even looking for it, as my date and I did.  The service is also good.  The people who work there are really nice, so that's of course part of the five star rating.  It's Mediterranean, so it might go without saying that there are vegetarian options aplenty, but I won't let it go unsaid.  Please, just do yourself a favor.  Go here and try it out yourself.  If you're a <hummus/> lover, as I am, your life is not complete without trying the <hummus/> HERE.  (You can thank me later.)  ; )
