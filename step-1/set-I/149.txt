We got a coupon to eat here when we checked in: $6.99 for breakfast and a second one for half, or free, or something to that effect. We went and had our breakfasts, which was served by a rather surely waitress and was average. If this had been our only experience, I would have given three stars, but another night we got in very late and were just looking for a late dinner and found ourselves at this place.
It was not very crowded, but was as loud as if three times as many people were there. There was a small group of trashy (very obese people), scream singing karaoke on a stage in the front of the restaurant. One of them was singing Eminem and the others were screaming and cheering. We sat down in the back, to try and avoid the chaos, but it was way too disruptive. Other people sitting there, who were in the middle of their dinners and therefore stuck there, were looking pained. We didn't bother putting ourselves through this and left. It's a crappy menu with <bread/> and <eggs/>, that's overpriced anyway.
I guess Rock and Rita's name really says it all, but basically if you're not a fall-down, cheap drunk, I don't think you'll have much to say about this place.
