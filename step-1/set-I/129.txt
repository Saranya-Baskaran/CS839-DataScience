Came here with my mother, husband and baby for brunch\/lunch. We were all quite happy with our choice. I think I was the "winner" by ordering the <french toast/>. It was practically half a loaf of <bread/>. My husband ordered the Stoney's breakfast, which is your <eggs/>, <toast/>, <bacon/>, etc, meal. My mother ordered the <omelet/>. Huge portions, BUT at around $11-$13 per breakfast meal, it was on the steep end of brunches and other than mine, I'm not sure the price is warranted, especially since it's a order at the counter, then find a seat with your number and wait for your meal type place. People were friendly and service was good (for what it was). I would give it a try if I was in the area again.
