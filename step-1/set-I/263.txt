Bad customer service, horrible for a 4 diamond hotel. Underneath the trained smiles to pacify you they don't do much to fix anything. Spent A lot of money on a Penthouse loft and the room was horrible, wall paper were peeling off in the bathroom and the carpet was wet. They say someone overflowed the bathtub and flooded the place. At least fix the problem before the next guess. So the apologized and invited me back this year to make up for the problem, great right that is a good move until they check me into an suite that had dog urine on the carpet, and they moved me to a lower floor but took them over a day to move me and did not tell me how long it would take we will call you when its ready, 5 calls and 3 visits to the front desk the room was ready at 3 pm the next day waisted the whole day for these people. Too many incidents to be a 4 Diamonds.... I don't think so
