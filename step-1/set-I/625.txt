The food is okay, but the service is terrible. My friend ordered a dry <noodle/> dish and instead they brought him one with <soup/> in it. Instead of remaking the entire dish, they poured out the <soup/> and gave him back the bowl. I really don't like it when people do that because it's not the same dish. It doesn't seem like the customer comes first here so we are taking our business elsewhere.
