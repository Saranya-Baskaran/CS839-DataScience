I started off with a <hot sour soup/> which tasted okay but was the strangest shade of light grey; not the usual colour one expects! We all ordered <fried dumplings/> - I ordered the <tofu/> <vegetable/> kind. It took absolute ages for our food to arrive which was really unexpected. Alas, it was not worth the wait. The filling of my <dumplings/> were too salty and the skins were dry. My friend's <dumplings/> were served in a plate that was pooling with water; which filled their <dumplings/> making them soggy. 

It was all so inconsistent with mediocre service, a long wait and food that was sloppy. Perhaps we went at a bad time but I was left with a bad impression that doesn't entice me to return. 

The only thing worth noting is that they had 4 types of <veggie dumplings/> on the menu which is a greater variety than normal.
