Small unassuming place that changes their menu every so often. Cool decor and vibe inside their 30 seat restaurant. Call for a reservation. 

We had their <beef tartar/> and <pork belly/> to start and a <salmon/> dish and <lamb/> meal for mains. Everything was incredible! I could go on at length about how all the listed ingredients really make their dishes amazing but honestly you just need to go. 

A bit outside of downtown montreal but take the metro out and it's less than a 10 minute walk from the station.
