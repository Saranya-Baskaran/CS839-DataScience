You see, I have a weakness. And that weakness is slushy drinks. <Slush puppies/>, <Mr. Mistys/>, <Icees/>, and the mother of them all the <pina colada/>. Which in a nutshell is why I like Fat Tuesdays. It's pure sugar and ice blended into a melange of delicious. Granted, all the red frozen drinks taste the exact same, but the <190 Octane/>, <Pina Colada/> thing, <Blue Raspberry/> and <Mango/> are delicious flavors that end in big old hangovers if you overindulge. But since they're frozen, it takes much longer to sip one down than a regular mixed drink, saving you money and still messing you up (provided you go the 190 Octane route).
