Came out on a Friday night, around 10pm. I ordered the <brisket/> ($13), it comes with a <soup/> or <salad/> and a side. I ordered <asparagus/> and a <caesar salad/>. The <sauce/> they served with it was way too salty for me. I ate the <brisket/> with the <BBQ sauce/> on the table. The <brisket/> was okay but dry for me. My grandmother ordered <ribs/>, the <St Louis ribs/> which have more fat than <meat/> on them and the waitress failed to let her know that. We didn't get a refill on our water during our visit. The waitress barely checked up on us. The manager came over and asked if everything was okay and we informed her about the <ribs/> and she said we could pick a <desert/> of our choice for the inconvenience. Very kind of her, but the waitress came back with a nasty attitude. The food was okay and the service was not great. - again I'm used to <Texas BBQ/> so yes my opinion is biased. And the <brisket/> does not compare.
