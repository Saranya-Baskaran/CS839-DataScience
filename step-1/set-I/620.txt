This place is the equivalent of salt lick Thai. I could taste very little else over the heavy hand with the sodium in the kitchen. None of the mouth watering aromatics that normally characterize Thai were detectable either. Sorry <basil/>, <lemongrass/>, <coconut milk/> and <galanga/>. "<Mixed vegetables/>" consisted of <bamboo shoots/> and <green beans/> (very adventurous), and the <bamboo shoots/> were undercooked and mega crunchy. Hot apparently translates to a mild tingle on your tongue, so don't go expecting to sate your Scoville craving. And to top it all off the portions we received were meager for the prices. 

I might have caught them on a bad day, but there's much better Thai to be had in the valley. Even though I live in Arcadia, I don't think there's any way I'm coming back.
