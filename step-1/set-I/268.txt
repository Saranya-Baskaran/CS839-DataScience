Love, love, love A Taste of the Caribbean! The <braised oxtails/> are heavenly, succulent and fall off the bone tender. They had me audibly moaning with delight the entire meal. The <plantains/> and <braised cabbage/> on the side were perfect sides, and the <rice/> with <pigeon peas/> was perfect for sopping up all that <oxtail sauce/>. 

The <jerk chicken/> was also fantastic, but since I was so busy hoarding my <oxtails/> I didn't get to try much of it. The <jerk/> was smoky, spicy, and highlighted the <chicken/> instead of overpowering it. Same sides, so at least we didn't have to fight over those. 

Make sure to try the <hibiscus flower drink/> (<sorrel/>) with <cloves/> floating in it. It accompanies the earthy, spicy flavor palate of the meat well and is very similar to the jicama offered up at Mexican joints.

In that respect it's kind of like being invited over to a friend's house for dinner and having her mom whoop up some of the most amazing ethnic food you never get at your Kraft <mac and cheese/> house. Next time I need leave room for the <cassava/> or <coconut cake/>! (Much harder to do than you may think. Trust me.)

Oh, they also have some interesting breakfast options like <smoked fish/> and such. Don't worry, they also have regular old <eggs/> on the menu. Check it out one morning for something outside of the norm!
