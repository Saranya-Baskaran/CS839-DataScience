I'm in lust with the <Shrimp Adriatico/>, which is an appetizer that has five big <tiger shrimp/> swimming in <garlic tomato sauce/> that's served with a loaf of <bread/> for dipping. It's filling enough to serve as an entire meal, or to share among friends.

On Sundays, pitchers of <sangria/> are half priced ($15 instead of $30) and are a refreshing way to relax with a group of friends in the afternoon. I prefer the <white wine/> over the red because it compliments the freshly sliced <apples/> and muddled citrus. Make sure to ask them to go easy on the <cinnamon/> though, or you may end up with an overpowering flavor and chalky texture.
