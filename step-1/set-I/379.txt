After reading so many reviews of bad customer service, I was prepared to be completely underserved when I got here, but every worker I came into contact with was polite; then again, I'm an outgoing person, and I tend to bring that out in people.  (Perhaps more of the angry reviewers should try to catch flies with <honey/> instead of vinegar?)  In fact, I think the clientele was more rude than the workers; I understand being "on the hunt", but seriously.  Are these people human?  I do agree, however, that the aisles are too small, and that could make almost anyone irritated.
