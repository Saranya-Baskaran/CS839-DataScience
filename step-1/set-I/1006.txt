We got delivery from here after seeing the good ratings on JustEat.ca. I have no idea what the ratings were for. We had the Basil Tofu and Red Curry Duck. The first was fine - the sauce a little oily - but just an average dish. The latter was just unacceptable. The curry itself was tasty but the pieces of duck were inedible; only bones, fat and skin with no actual meat. For a $17 plate of food I expected a lot more. Strongly wouldn't recommend; maybe their dine-in is better
