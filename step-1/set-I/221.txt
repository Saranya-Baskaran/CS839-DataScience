Stopped by here to pick up a dozen <donuts/> for a early morning meeting.

I found the selection of <donuts/> to be very minimal. They didn't even have <sugar donuts/>. I thought that was a basic must have <donut/>. I also thought they were a bit over priced.

The guy at the counter was nice so I can't complain about their customer service.

My staff loved the <donuts/>, they just didn't appeal to me.
