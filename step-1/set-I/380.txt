I'd been to the Hash House downtown, but not this particular location in the LINQ.  This time around I had breakfast - specifically the <pancake/> (yes, it was one, singular pancake.  See picture below.).  The waiter we had was attentive and checked on us often.  Also, the fresh-squeezed <juice/> was very delicious!
