Saw that there was a new place in the neighborhood and decided to try it out. They did not disappoint!

Had ordered the <buttermilk fried chicken sandwich/> and a classic <poutine/> to go.

The <buttermilk fried chicken sandwich/> was excellent! It was very light and was not greasy at all! Will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu.

As for the <poutine/>... It was soggy and nothing special. Will be back to try the <onion rings/>.
