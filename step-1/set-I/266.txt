I really dig a good ole Mom and Pop greasy spoon diner.

But what this little place lacks in ambiance, it makes up for in food. I had a tuna melt on rye that was to die for. Anyone who knows me can vouch for the fact that I believe the <tuna melt/> to be a <sandwich/> of the gods. Fuck ambrosia. They were eating warm albacore over buttery, crisp <bread/>, smothered in <cheddar cheese/> and pan fried to perfection. And the <fries/> were sprinkled with some kind of magic pixie dust that endowed them with the ability to make me profusely salivate.

Everyone at the table ordered something different (from the <hot roast beef/> dinner to the <fried fish/>, <Caesar salad/> to the <pork fritter sandwich/>) and it was agreed that all entrees were wicked, fricken good. And breakfast is served all day long. Super score!

So go, pay homage to John Wayne, and he shall reward you with some good eats!
