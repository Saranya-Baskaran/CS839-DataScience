 
The desserts were all good, however the <fudge ice cream/>, is really just <chocolate ice cream/>, nothing special. The <lemon curd/> tasted like <lemon pie/> filling and was delicious and the <bread pudding/> was heavenly! Seriously, it was SO good. 
I think everyone left feeling really satisfied.
