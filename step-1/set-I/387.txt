Delicious gourmet food to be had here!  I had two different dishes - both vegetarian - and I enjoyed them both immensely.  Don't come here if you plan on cramming yourself with as much food as you can eat; rather, come here to enjoy the experience of eating delicious <pot roast/>.  The portion sizes are on the smaller size, but all of the tastes are worth savoring.
