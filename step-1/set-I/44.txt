Terrible service and not so great drinks.

We happen to be in the plaza and saw this place for <bubble tea/>, so we decided to grab a few to go.

The menu items itself had different options than your typically <bubble tea/> place. Their specialty are <mousse/> drinks - which we had no idea what exactly it was. So when we asked the staff, they said it was some sort of <cheese/>. 

For a Sunday afternoon, they were also out of <grass jelly/> and <pudding/>, which are ingredients in quite a few of their drinks (so not sure how that works).

We had ordered the following:
- <slush mango/> (came with <tapioca/> and <mousse/>)
- <peach ice tea/>
- <oolong milk tea/>
- <supernova kumquat lemonade/>

And when we asked what the difference between a <supernova kumquat lemonade/> under the galaxy drinks section (which are supposed to be layered drinks), and the <kumquat lemonade/>, they said it had a layer of <blue mousse/> - so we were like ok we will try it then. But what came was just a bigger cup size of the <kumquat lemonade/>. When we asked them again, they said it was just a size difference, that's what makes it supernova - which is pretty dumb to me as on the menu both items had the same two size choices of regular or large. 

The <mango slush/> and the <roasted oolong milk tea/> wasn't bad. But the other two was not that great. The <tea/> had a big floral taste that overpowered everything. There was no <peach/> taste in the <peach ice tea/>. The <kumquat/> one had no <kumquat/> taste and was just bitter from the <lime/> and it tasted like it had no <sugar/> in it at all.
