Dear Macayo's, 

Your patio was the highlight of the evening. It's backed up against a lake and there was a duck that watched me eat. He had a shiny green head. It was nice. I made him my zen when all I wanted to do was lash out in frustration over the meal. If I could offer a suggestion to benefit both the <duck/> and myself, perhaps you could pipe some music out onto the patio, because listening to Suzie and Sally Suburb bitch about their waistlines while committing refried sin was pretty grating.

By this point in the meal I really shouldn't have been surprised at how bland everything was, because I was on to your ploy of substituting flavor for gobs of <cream cheese/> and a heavy hand with the <salt/> shaker. But despite stiff competition from the bland pico de gallo and the puzzling "<Baja  sauce/>", it was the shitamole took the grad prize of suckdom for the evening. I have never tasted weaker <guac/>. You must have used some terrible <avocados/> and whipped them with <corn syrup/> or some other food-like filler. There wasn't a zing of <cilantro/> or <lemon juice/>, no hint of <Serrano/> spiciness, not even the tang of some <onion/>, although I did see a couple soggy <tomatoes/> bits added for color.
