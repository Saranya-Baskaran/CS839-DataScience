Obviously, this is a steakhouse, so it goes without saying that this place isn't built for vegetarians.  However, I enjoyed what I had - <broccoli/>, <green beans/>, and some <mac and cheese/>.  The service was excellent, as was the <wine/>, the <bread/> provided, and the <birthday cake/> they made for my boyfriend.  The look of the place is the coolest part, though, especially from the outside looking in.  It's located inside a mall, and words can't quite describe the architecture of the structure the restaurant is in, but it's neat and adds to the experience.
