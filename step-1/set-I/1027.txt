The vibe of this place is the real draw.  It has an intimate, almost jazz club feel, rather than the typical Vegas dance-oriented night club.  I like the piano and the singers they have.  All that being said, the drinks (and I'm assuming food, as well) are expensive, so plan accordingly.  I think there was a cover charge, as well, when I went (though I can't remember what it was).  Interesting place, but be sure to bring a fresh credit card with you.
