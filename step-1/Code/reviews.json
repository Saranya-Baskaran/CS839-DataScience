had called several weeks ago to make a reservation and somehow they didnt have it  Apparently its an answering service for reservations and they say they call you back if they cant accommodate you  He never received a call back so the assumption was that the reservation was alright  Unfortunately as I said there was no reservation  The staff apologized profusely though and luckily there was space and they set up a table for us right away  We ordered from the drink menu and I will say that they drinks are very expensive  The wine is what you would expect and the mixed drink at least the one I had the Smith Lemonade was fantastic but it was also  which is steep even for Toronto bar standards  As I said we ordered from the Summerlicious menu  I have heard many comments online that people are feeling disillusioned with Summerlicious because so many restaurants give you the cheapest options and its not worth the cost  This was NOT the case with Smith at all  There were several great options to choose from and the food was excellent  I had the curried carrot soup which was spicy but great  Every one else in my party also enjoyed their various appetizers  My main course was a Georgian Bay

majority and stopped dined out with the family at restaurants that specialized in satisfying even the blandest of palettes  I must say you continue to exceed my wildest expectations in that respect I had to continue looking down at my plate just to make sure the  calories I was consuming were more than just a mirage of Mexican food I will admit that I have a long standing simmering hatred for you Macayos  So maybe this biases my opinion a bit  I cant in my right mind fathom why I thought you deserved a second chance last night  I think its testament to the fact that sometimes I make super stupid decisions on an empty stomach especially when Im hungry enough to eat the ass end out of week dead burro  I suppose I was expecting something a bit more appetizing than that stretch of hyperbole  How wrong I was Your patio was the highlight of the evening  Its backed up against a lake and there was a duck that watched me eat  He had a shiny green head  It was nice  I made him my zen when all I wanted to do was lash out in frustration over the meal  If I could offer a suggestion to benefit both the duck and myself perhaps you could pipe some music out onto the patio because listening to Suzie and Sally Suburb bitch about their waistlines while committing refried sin was pretty grating The food however far outshone those cackling soccer moms in terms of annoyance  I dont know who you think you are Macayos but charging  bucks an entree at your establishment just about gave me a heart attack long before the lard had a chance to bully up on my arteries  Maybe its because I think you have the street value of a gum job from a run down whore but I have to say that those prices were shocking  I could travel the valley over and find better Mexican food for much cheaper  For that price I expect outstanding quality and taste or at least a hip see and be seen environment  All you have is a duck working in your favor  I do have a serious question for you though whats with smothering your entrees in cream cheese and trying to pass it off as Baja sauce It was the same jalapeno spread I get on my bagel in the morning but with even less heat and flavor  I suggest renaming it Manhattan sauce in honor of the bagel and schmear capital of the nation and I think it would be a touching homage to the Pace Picante New York City commercials  I also cant understand why the majority of your entrees offer either rice or beans but few have these in conjunction  Those are universal standards at a Mexican food joint and the ultimate test of quality since theyre comparable the valley over  Do they bring you shame Is that why you dont want to offer them both Or are you just a cheap nickel and diming motherfucker Macayos Im more apt to believe the latter because you charged me two bucks for guacamole without informing me that it cost extra  Then you delivered a pile of gelatinous green goop of questionable origin that had absolutely zero flavor  By this point in the meal I really shouldnt have been surprised at how bland everything was because I was on to your ploy of substituting flavor for gobs of cream cheese and a heavy hand with the salt shaker  But despite stiff competition from the bland pico de gallo and the puzzling Baja  sauce it was the shitamole took the grad prize of suckdom for the evening  I have never tasted weaker guac  You must have used some terrible avocados and whipped them with corn syrup or some other foodlike filler  There wasnt a zing of cilantro or lemon juice no hint of Serrano spiciness not even the tang of some onion although I did see a couple soggy tomatoes bits added for color  I dont think I will ever be coming back Macayos  Its not you its    I cant lie even to spare your feelings  Its you  Its all you  Im breaking up in a public setting because Im scared that youll key my car while by back is turned or at the least smother it in cream cheese  I know youre into that freaky shit Wishing you

bubble tea place  Their specialty are mousse drinks  which we had no idea what exactly it was  So when we asked the staff they said it was some sort of cheese  For a Sunday afternoon they were also out of grass jelly and pudding which are ingredients in quite a few of their drinks so not sure how that works The service is really bad they dont understand English so when you asked them about the menu items they cant really explain what they are We had ordered the following slush mango came with tapioca and mousse peach ice tea roasted oolong milk tea supernova kumquat lemonadeAnd when we asked what the difference between a supernova kumquat lemonade under the galaxy drinks section which are supposed to be layered drinks and the kumquat lemonade they said it had a layer of blue mousse  so we were like ok we will try it then  But what came was just a bigger cup size of the kumquat lemonade  When we asked them again they said it was just a size difference thats what makes it supernova  which is pretty dumb to me as on the menu both items had the same two size choices of regular or large  The mango slush and the roasted oolong milk tea wasnt bad  But the other two was not that great  The tea had a big floral taste that overpowered everything  There was no peach taste in the peach ice tea  The kumquat one had no kumquat taste and was just bitter from the lime and it tasted like it had no sugar in it at all I guess if you need a nonbusy place to use WIFI and work then this is the place no one wants to come here Also  their gimmick also seems to be the lightbulb drinks which were
