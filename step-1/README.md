#Introduction

We are identifying food entities in a dataset of Yelp reviews. 

> Food entity is defined as any noun that can occur in a food menu excluding generic terms like food, water and lunch.

Each file in the [set-B directory](https://github.com/yogeshchellappa/CS839-DataScience/tree/master/step-1/set-B) is text file containing a review with annotations for each food entity.

Each food entity is annotated in its entirety using xml tags `< />`

*1 `train_test_splitter.ipynb`: Randomly splits set B into sets I and J.
*2 `getTrainingData.py`: Given a directory of reviews it generates a JSON array of review objects. Each review object has an id, review text without tags and list of food entities.
*3 `ngramsGenerator_wordpos.py`: Calculates the n-grams and generate CSV file with identifiers, ngrams and position indexes.
*4 `main.py`: Reads the CSV generated by `ngramsGenerator_wordpos.py`, prepares training and validation features and labels, trains all the classifiers in `classifiers.py` and calculates quality metrics.
