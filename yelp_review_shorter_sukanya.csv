You can find all the details of the hike at http:\/\/www.birdandhike.com\/Hike\/Other_Areas\/Lone_Mt\/_Lone_Mt.htm

It's a steep 600 foot climb. Hiking poles would come in handy as there are some really steep spots where it's easy to slip on loose rocks. 

The climb up is not too dangerous. Most slips will only result in scratches and bruises but watch your step at the summit. The top is very narrow a slip here could be disastrous. 

Make sure you bring plenty of water. I'd avoid hiking this in the summer as there is absolutely no shade any where.",5,0,2

One of my companions had the <meatloaf/> and he said it was awesome!

To be honest I haven't eaten in a Sonic in forever. So parking at one of their little ordering machines I got out of my car and was about to walk in because I didn't know if I could order food to go while parked at one of their ordering machines. Also I'm sure there is a better name then ""ordering machine""...maybe ordering station, vending space???? I'm sure if you've ever been to one you know what I'm referring to.

Anyway a young lady comes outside to tell me how a Sonic works. I could order from a machine outside to eat at one of their tables, or I could eat in my car while parked at one of their ordering stations, or they actually have a drive through.  I'm sure she must have wondered what was up with the ""old guy"" who didn't know how a fast food joint worked. Anyway she was kind and polite and did her best not to make me feel like a absent minded ""old guy""

Weighing my options I decided to use their drive through. I ordered a couple <hot dogs/>. One mustard only and a <Chicago style dog/>. A order of tater tots and a number 1 which is just a classic <burger/>, <fries/> and a drink.

As is typical for a fast food joint it was staffed with a very young group of people. What was not typical for a fast food joint is they actually got my order right.

I wanted to get a bottle of <soda/> to go but they don't sell it by the bottle and I didn't want to spill it in my car on the way home. So I passed on the <soda/>.

We found the entire meal to be okay. The <ribs/> were very pink in the middle. I suppose some like it that way. But they were much more pink than we prefer.

Neither of us liked the <mac and cheese/>. We found the <macaronis/> to be way over cooked. We prefer them to have a little bit of firmness.

The <cole slaw/> was the best part of the meal, although it was a bit dry. If there was a little slaw juice in with it it would be great!

I also saw mention of them being over priced. This may or may not be the case but he's trying to make a decent profit like all of us. If you know the price you want to pay and his stuff is to high then look elsewhere.

The staff was very helpful and friendly! The place seemed neat and clean.

To be honest I can't remember what type of hot dog I ordered. I do recall that I was not overly impressed. It wasn't bad it just wasn't anything special.

Based on the customer service I""ll probably still gives this place another try in the future.",0,1,0

Typical CVS.

If the noisy living conditions get to be too much you can always go for a walk in the park across the street and pass the time by watching drug transactions.",1,0,0

The location is right across from the Mandalay Bay so due to it's proximity to major hotels it's often very busy which means a longer wait then other fast food joints off the strip.

The staff do their job. Nothing more nothing less. And like most Panda's the food is edible. Nothing spectacular here.",1,0,2

We were promptly seated and our drinks delivered. 

I don't like to be kept waiting to place my order when I'm hungry. So after waiting what I felt was an inordinate amount of time I decided to leave and eat elsewhere.

My girl decided to stay and eat her breakfast. She said the food was good, so we'll maybe try it another time and see if I can get an order placed.",0,1,1

My girlfriend and I stopped in again today and as usual the service was great. The place was really packed and we had to stand around awhile to get a table. We didn't mind as we know the food is worth the wait.

Even as busy as they were the staff remained friendly and cheerful.

If you decide to visit this place for karaoke you'll do a lot more listening than singing. You'll be lucky to get up to sing once every hour.

Drinks are overpriced and the service is very slow.

If you wanna go to watch others sing they do have some good regulars. Who, by the way, you'll notice get up to sing a lot more than you do. The food is also decent.

I ordered the <<cheese/> <burger/>/> and <fries/> my girlfriend ordered the blt. 

Her order was finished and put out to be delivered to her. By the time a waitress got around to bringing it to her it was cold.

We never were given silverware and had to ask a neighbor at the counter if she could slide some of the other silverware over to us.

My <cheeseburger/> was excellent, the <fries/> were soso. The blt might have been good were it not cold.

The place seemed clean and the staff was friendly enough when they were around.

Their major problem is a major lack of attentiveness.",0,1,0
